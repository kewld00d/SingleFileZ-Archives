# SingleFileZ-Archives
My repo archive of my collection of saved webpages , to read later + etc etc. Archive was created using SingleFile extension, which is able to save and compress webpages in a self-contained and cool self extracting zip file  but is just an easy to use html file  that enables good viewing and archiving of websites  with the added bonus of small file sizes and no folders or other files: just 1  html file per save or zip auto uploaded to this Github repo
