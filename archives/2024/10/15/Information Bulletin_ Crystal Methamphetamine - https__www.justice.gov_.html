Table 1. Estimated U.S. Methamphetamine
Prices, Powdered and Crystal, June 2002  

Overview

High purity crystal methamphetamine, commonly known as ice
or glass, is becoming increasingly available in the United States. Asian
criminal groups that traditionally distributed crystal methamphetamine in
Hawaii and on the West Coast are now distributing the drug in other areas
of the country as well. Moreover, Mexican drug trafficking organizations
(DTOs) and criminal groups are becoming increasingly involved in the
production and distribution of crystal methamphetamine, according to the
Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and many state and local law
enforcement officials.

 

Background

Crystal methamphetamine is a colorless, odorless form of d-methamphetamine, a
powerful stimulant. It resembles glass fragments or shiny blue-white
"rocks" of various sizes. Street names for the drug include batu,
crystal, glass, hiropon, ice, shabu, shards, Tina, ventana, and vidrio. Crystal
methamphetamine and powdered methamphetamine both contain the same active
chemical compound; however, crystal methamphetamine typically has a higher
purity level and may produce longer-lasting, more intense physiological effects.
In small doses crystal methamphetamine can heighten alertness, stimulate
physical activity, and suppress appetite. Chronic abuse can cause psychotic and
violent behavior characterized by intense paranoia, visual and auditory
hallucinations, and out-of-control rages.
Crystal methamphetamine often is compared to crack cocaine. The drugs produce
similar physiological effects, are highly addictive, and typically are smoked
using a glass pipe. Crystal methamphetamine also may be injected. Immediately
after smoking or injecting crystal methamphetamine, abusers experience a brief,
intense sensation, or rush, that is followed by a high that may last 12 hours or
more. Crack cocaine abusers experience the same effects for only 20 to 30
minutes. Withdrawal symptoms associated with both crystal methamphetamine and
crack cocaine include drug cravings, paranoia, and depression.
Crystal methamphetamine is produced using a "washing" technique
that involves dissolving powdered d-methamphetamine in a solvent such as acetone
or denatured alcohol. The mixture is allowed to evaporate, causing crystals to
form around the edge of the container in which it is being mixed. Large crystals
form when the solution evaporates at room temperature, and small crystals form
when the solution evaporates in a cold environment such as a refrigerator or
freezer. The crystals then are collected and dried, typically on a paper towel.
The purity of the finished product varies depending on the amount of washing and
the laboratory operator's level of experience.

Risk
of Explosion

Law enforcement personnel
should exercise extreme caution when opening refrigerators and freezers
found at crystal methamphetamine production sites. The vapors from the
solvents used to convert powdered methamphetamine to crystal
methamphetamine are extremely volatile and can accumulate in a
refrigerator or freezer during the evaporation process. These vapors may
explode when the appliance's inside light activates as the door is opened.
Law enforcement personnel should immediately unplug all refrigerators and
freezers found at crystal methamphetamine laboratories to avoid this risk.

Crystal methamphetamine production and distribution traditionally have been
associated with Asian criminal groups. These groups either produce the drug in
the United States or smuggle it into the country from laboratory sites located
in countries such as China, the Philippines, South Korea, and Taiwan. Since the
mid-1990s Mexican DTOs and criminal groups have supplied powdered
methamphetamine to Asian criminal groups in Hawaii and on the West Coast for
conversion to crystal methamphetamine. Mexican DTOs and criminal groups now
produce crystal methamphetamine in Mexico, California, and southwestern states
and use their established transportation networks to distribute the drug
throughout the United States.

Availability

Crystal methamphetamine was once available only in Asian American communities
in Hawaii and to a lesser extent on the West Coast; however, the drug is now
available in other communities and areas of the United States. Law enforcement
officials attribute the increasing availability of crystal methamphetamine to
the involvement of Mexican DTOs and criminal groups in the production and
distribution of the drug, as well as to increasing Asian criminal group activity
in other areas of the country. Further, DEA reports that Mexican DTOs and
criminal groups are producing and selling crystal methamphetamine for
significantly less than rival Asian criminal groups.
The purity of crystal methamphetamine generally is much higher than powdered
methamphetamine, and crystal methamphetamine typically commands a higher price.
Nationwide, the cost of 1-pound quantities of crystal methamphetamine ranges
from $10,000 to $30,000, compared with $3,500 to $20,000 for powdered
methamphetamine. The DEA Southwest Laboratory reports that the purity of
powdered methamphetamine samples from Arizona, California, and Nevada averages
35 percent; however, it is not uncommon for the purity of crystal
methamphetamine samples to exceed 90 percent.

Table 1. Estimated U.S.
Methamphetamine Prices, Powdered and Crystal, June 2002
The estimated U.S. price for a pound of powdered methamphetamine in June 2002
was $3,500 to $20,000, and $10,000 to $30,000 for a pound of crystal
methamphetamine.
The estimated U.S. price for an ounce of powdered methamphetamine in June
2002 was $350 to $3,000, and $1,000 to $3,000 for an ounce of crystal
methamphetamine.
The estimated U.S. price for a gram of powdered methamphetamine in June 2002
was $20 to $150, and $100 to $500 for a pound of crystal methamphetamine.

Arizona. According to the Peoria Police Department, the predominant drug
problem in its jurisdiction is crystal methamphetamine, known there as shards.
Crystal methamphetamine sells for approximately $8,000 per pound in the Phoenix
area, which includes the city of Peoria. The DEA Phoenix Division reports that
in its jurisdiction crystal methamphetamine, known as glass in Phoenix,
typically is produced by independent Caucasian producers who operate small-scale
laboratories that are capable of producing 1 ounce or less of the drug per
production cycle.
California. During the first quarter of FY2002, law enforcement
authorities dismantled two separate organizations distributing multipound
quantities of methamphetamine and crystal methamphetamine in the San Francisco
Bay Area. Most of the methamphetamine seized in those incidents exceeded 95
percent purity. In a separate incident the San Francisco Metropolitan Task
Force, with the assistance of the San Francisco Police Department, seized
approximately 3 pounds of crystal methamphetamine with a purity of 98 percent.
According to the DEA Western Regional Laboratory, the cleanliness and purity of
the methamphetamine seized had not been seen for some time. It is unknown
whether the methamphetamine was domestic- or foreign-produced, although several
traffickers in the Bay Area appear to have mastered the process of washing
methamphetamine to produce high purity crystal methamphetamine. According to
DEA, 1 pound of crystal methamphetamine (known in that area as ice) sold for
$13,500 to $18,000 in the San Francisco area in the second quarter of FY2002.
MSM Used as a Cutting Agent

MSM, the common commercial name for the chemical
methylsulfonylmethane, also
is known as methylsulfone and dimethylsulfone (DMSO2).
As a cutting agent for methamphetamine, MSM offers many advantages. Pure MSM
is an odorless, white, crystalline powder that is highly soluble and mixes
readily with most substances without leaving a residue. MSM usually is added to
methamphetamine during the final stages of production. Methamphetamine cut with
MSM often appears to be uncut because after the chemicals are combined and the
mixture cools, the MSM recrystallizes, resembling pure methamphetamine.
MSM distributors claim the substance is beneficial as a pain reliever and for
animal and human connective tissue regeneration. Other alleged benefits for both
animals and humans include the reduction of inhalant allergen reactions; relief
from the symptoms of lung dysfunction; relief of leg and back cramps, muscle
spasms, and general soreness; improved overall health; and elevated mood. MSM is
readily available in powder and tablet forms at livestock feed and equine tack
stores, "super" pet food chains, warehouse stores, human nutrition
centers, and upscale grocery stores. MSM is available through mail order equine
and veterinary supply catalogs and on numerous Internet sites.

According to the DEA Oakland Resident Office, the majority of methamphetamine
investigations in its jurisdiction involve crystal methamphetamine. In the
second quarter of FY2002, there were two large crystal methamphetamine seizures
in the Oakland area. In one incident DEA agents seized approximately 3 pounds of
crystal methamphetamine and 1 pound of MSM, which was being used as a cutting
agent. In a separate incident the Oakland police seized approximately 2 pounds
of crystal methamphetamine at a Hayward home. In that incident an estimated
$50,000 worth of the drug was distributed on a weekly basis. According to law
enforcement sources in southern Alameda County, Filipino and other Asian
American traffickers are involved in the production and sale of crystal
methamphetamine in their jurisdictions.
According to the Central Valley HIDTA, crystal methamphetamine production and
abuse appear to be increasing in the middle valley. Filipino and Hawaiian drug
traffickers are the primary groups responsible for methamphetamine production in
the Central Valley (San Joaquin) region. According to the Central Valley HIDTA,
in November 2001 a total of 7.5 pounds of crystal methamphetamine was seized in
the area around Hanford in Kings County. During 2001 the Central Valley HIDTA
task forces seized three crystal methamphetamine laboratories in the southern
valley. In 2001 crystal methamphetamine sold for $12,000 to $15,000 per pound.
According to the HIDTA, as a marketing ploy food coloring occasionally is added
during the crystallization process, turning the methamphetamine black;
"black ice" is supposedly more potent.
The DEA Los Angeles Division reports that crystal methamphetamine is readily
available in the Los Angeles area, and availability is concentrated
predominately in Riverside and San Bernardino Counties. Hispanic criminal groups
and gangs continue to emerge as the dominant crystal methamphetamine
distributors in its jurisdiction. These groups sell high purity crystal
methamphetamine for significantly less than rival Asian groups. DEA reports that
the Los Angeles area is the source of supply for the majority of crystal
methamphetamine distributed in Hawaii. On October 11, 2001, agents from the DEA
Los Angeles Division seized 7 pounds of crystal methamphetamine in Van Nuys. The
drugs were concealed in seven 1-pound bags in a water cooler. On December 4,
2001, 499 grams were seized in South Gate. On August 8, 2002, DEA announced that
more than 57 individuals in Southern California were arrested in connection with
a 2-year investigation involving the production and distribution of
methamphetamine, distribution of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, known
as ecstasy), and drug money laundering. During the course of the investigation,
over 33 pounds of methamphetamine, 8 pounds of crystal methamphetamine, 196
gallons of methamphetamine oil, and 100 pounds of pseudo-ephedrine were seized,
as were weapons, currency, vehicles, and 30,000 MDMA tablets.
The Santa Ana Police Department reports that Mexican criminal groups dominate
the methamphetamine market in the city of Santa Ana and sell both powdered and
crystal methamphetamine. In this area high purity crystal methamphetamine, known
as ice, sells for $10,000 to $13,000 per pound. Medium purity crystal
methamphetamine, known as glass, sells for $5,000 to $8,000 per pound and is
reported to be the most popular form of methamphetamine distributed in the city;
it is smuggled into the area from Mexico.

Colorado. DEA as well as numerous state and local task forces and police
departments report that the availability of crystal methamphetamine (known as
glass) has increased throughout Colorado. Crystal methamphetamine sells for
approximately 40 percent more than powdered methamphetamine in Colorado, and it
has become the form of methamphetamine that is most popular with abusers.
Florida. According to the DEA Miami Division, on November 27, 2001,
agents seized 1 kilogram of crystal methamphetamine that was delivered to a
residence by a package delivery service. The agents arrested three individuals
and seized 28 MDMA tablets and 8 vials of GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate). According
to DEA, some members of the homosexual community in Fort Lauderdale use crystal
methamphetamine extensively.
Georgia. According to the DEA Atlanta Division, there has been a large
increase in the supply of crystal methamphetamine available in Atlanta. Clubs in
downtown Atlanta are a focal point for the abuse of crystal methamphetamine. One
sample of crystal methamphetamine tested 99.7 percent pure. In February 2002 the
Oklahoma Highway Patrol seized 42 pounds of methamphetamine destined for
Atlanta. One pound of the seized methamphetamine was tested and found to be
crystal methamphetamine.
Hawaii. In Hawaii, unlike other states, crystal methamphetamine is the
drug of choice and is more commonly abused than powdered methamphetamine.
Crystal methamphetamine conversion laboratories are more prevalent than
production laboratories. Mexican criminal groups have replaced traditional Asian
criminal groups as the primary transporters and wholesale distributors of
crystal methamphetamine in Hawaii. In the early 1990s law enforcement
authorities in Hawaii dismantled several large Asian, primarily Korean, criminal
groups that dominated the transportation of crystal methamphetamine into Hawaii
from Asia. Asian criminal groups continue to transport and distribute some
crystal methamphetamine in Hawaii, but to a lesser extent.
Currently most of the crystal methamphetamine available in Hawaii is
transported into the state already in crystal form. Mexican criminal groups
transport crystal methamphetamine from the West Coast, primarily California, as
well as from Mexico. To a lesser extent, it is transported from Asian sources
via couriers on commercial aircraft. Crystal methamphetamine also is produced in
Hawaii. Powdered methamphetamine is processed through "conversion" or
wash laboratories where it is treated with acetone to produce crystal
methamphetamine. These laboratories are found predominantly on the island of
Oahu, but some have been seized on the outer islands. According to 2000 data
from Operation Jetway--a nationwide interdiction program that operates at
airports, train stations, bus stations, package shipment facilities, post
offices, and airport hotels and motels--in Hawaii there were eight seizures of
crystal methamphetamine totaling slightly more than 11 kilograms. According to
the Hawaii HIDTA Airport Task Force, more than 21 kilograms of crystal
methamphetamine were seized at the Honolulu International Airport from July 1999
through June 2000. According to DEA, crystal methamphetamine sold for $30,000 in
the first quarter of FY2002, although inflated prices on the island of Hawaii
reached $45,000 to $70,000 per pound.
Illinois. The Chicago HIDTA reports that Asian criminal groups now
distribute crystal methamphetamine in the Chicago area. Crystal methamphetamine
is obtained from sources of supply in Asia and smuggled by couriers aboard
commercial airlines into the area. Asian criminal groups also obtain powdered
methamphetamine from criminal groups composed of Mexican nationals located on
the West Coast, convert the powder into crystal methamphetamine, and then
distribute it in the Chicago area.

Kansas. The DEA Kansas City District Office reports that Mexican
nationals are involved in the distribution of crystal methamphetamine in the
area. Law enforcement investigations have revealed ties to methamphetamine
laboratories operated by Mexican nationals in Phoenix, Arizona, and Riverside,
California. According to DEA, crystal methamphetamine sells for $18,000 per
pound in the Kansas City area.
Mississippi. According to the DEA New Orleans Division, recently obtained
information indicates that crystal methamphetamine is being sold in Hinds,
Copiah, and Forrest Counties in Mississippi. Crystal methamphetamine only
recently has become common in Mississippi. It likely is being transported from
sources in California, Texas, and Tennessee by private vehicle.
An ounce of crystal methamphetamine with a purity level of 97 percent was
seized in Jackson. The Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics reported that the crystal
methamphetamine (known there as ice) had been produced in California or Texas.
The Mississippi Bureau of Narcotics also has encountered crystal methamphetamine
in northeastern Mississippi.
Missouri. Increasingly, reports have been received that crystal
methamphetamine is being distributed in Kansas City (MO). The Metro
Methamphetamine Drug Task Force in Kansas City reported that a 16-year-old
Caucasian female was found unconscious in a Kansas City motel room from an
overdose of crystal methamphetamine.
Nebraska. According to the Omaha Police Department and the Western
Intelligence Narcotics Group (WING) Drug Task Force in Scottsbluff, in July 2002
two seizures of crystal methamphetamine were made in Omaha and Hemingford. In
one of the seizures the crystal methamphetamine, which resembled shards of
glass, had been mailed from Phoenix, Arizona. In Nebraska crystal
methamphetamine is known as ice.
Nevada. The DEA Las Vegas District Office reports that crystal
methamphetamine is available in its jurisdiction in limited quantities, but
demand for the drug is increasing. Mexican criminal groups transport the crystal
methamphetamine from Southern California, primarily Los Angeles, into Nevada.
These criminal groups also distribute the drug in the state. In Las Vegas
crystal methamphetamine sells for $10,000 to $12,000 per pound and $1,000 to
$1,500 per ounce.
New Mexico. According to the FY2003 Southwest Border HIDTA report, some
international DTOs operating in New Mexico have production cells in Mexico that
produce methamphetamine; however, the capabilities of these laboratories have
not been clearly reported. The HIDTA also reports that a six-member criminal
group in New Mexico obtains crystal methamphetamine from California and
distributes it in gram quantities. The Lea County Drug Task Force in Hobbs, New
Mexico, reports that officers have encountered crystal methamphetamine from Los
Angeles, California, in its jurisdiction. One pound of crystal methamphetamine
in Lea County sells for $16,000--more than double the price for powdered
methamphetamine. However, in Lincoln County, narcotics officers report that
crystal methamphetamine (locally known as ice) is frequently available for sale
at nearly the same price as powdered methamphetamine.
South Dakota. The South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation Drug
Task Force reports that Mexican criminal groups are now distributing crystal
methamphetamine in the state. Previously, methamphetamine was available only in
its powdered form and was supplied by Mexican criminal groups and local
independent producers.
According to the South Dakota Division of Criminal Investigation Drug Task
Force, crystal methamphetamine remains available in South Dakota. A seizure of
crystal methamphetamine was made in Rapid City in October 2001. Mexican
nationals residing in Rapid City were transporting the crystal methamphetamine
from Salt Lake City, Utah, to Rapid City, where it was being sold for $300 per
eight ball (one-eighth ounce).

Texas. According to the DEA Houston Division, crystal methamphetamine is
being sold in nightclubs in Houston and is abused by Asians and African
Americans. During a vehicle stop in Montgomery County (north of Houston) on May
13, 2002, officers from the Montgomery County Special Investigation Unit and the
Texas Department of Public Safety Narcotics Division seized 122.9 grams of
crystal methamphetamine--one-half of which was concealed in a hollowed-out
candle. The individuals involved were Caucasian males in their twenties.
Officers from the Austin Police Department also report that the availability of
crystal methamphetamine has recently increased in their jurisdiction, and they
believe the drug is being produced locally. In July 2002 the Austin Police
Department seized a crystal methamphetamine laboratory that was being operated
by an 18 year old.
Wisconsin. The Douglas County Task Force first identified the
availability of crystal methamphetamine in January 2002. Mexican and Asian
criminal groups are the primary sources of supply for the drug, which is now
readily available in the area. In this area crystal methamphetamine typically is
sold in small retail quantities; however, one-half ounce to 1-ounce quantities
have been seized. The drug generally sells for twice the price of powdered
methamphetamine.
Federal Sentencing

Sentences for crystal methamphetamine "ice" are determined by the
U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which are in turn based on the statutory sentences,
including quantity-based mandatory minimum sentences, in the Controlled
Substances Act. For methamphetamine generally (leaving aside the crystal
methamphetamine "ice" form), the statute and guidelines both set forth
alternative formulations for determining quantity-based sentences because
"actual" or "pure" methamphetamine (sometimes referred to in
the sentencing context as "meth-actual") is distinguished from "a
mixture or substance containing" methamphetamine (sometimes called
"meth-mixture"). The quantities of meth-actual that trigger the
various mandatory minimum sentences and Guidelines sentencing ranges are
one-tenth of those of meth-mixture. Thus, 5-year mandatory sentences are
triggered by trafficking in 5 grams of meth-actual or 50 grams of meth-mixture;
10-year mandatory sentences are triggered by trafficking in 50 grams of
meth-actual or 500 grams of meth-mixture. A mixture containing methamphetamine
weighing 10 grams at 50 percent purity could either be sentenced as 10 grams of
meth-mixture or 5 grams of meth-actual (although the higher sentence should
prevail).
The term crystal methamphetamine "ice" does not appear in the
statutory provisions prescribing methamphetamine penalties. In the Sentencing
Guidelines, "ice" is defined as a mixture or substance containing
d-methamphetamine hydrochloride of at least 80 percent purity. Unlike other
methamphetamine mixtures, however, any quantity of "ice" is treated as
meth-actual for Guidelines sentencing purposes. Thus, if the 10-gram mixture
described above were "ice," it would be sentenced as 10 grams of
meth-actual. Because the alternative sentencing scheme does not apply to
"ice," traffickers in this crystallized form of methamphetamine will
tend to receive longer sentences than other methamphetamine traffickers.

Outlook

The increasing availability of crystal methamphetamine may
indicate that Mexican DTOs and criminal groups and Asian criminal groups are
attempting to create demand for crystal methamphetamine throughout the United
States. Mexican criminal groups operating in the United States pose the greatest
threat due to their existing methamphetamine production, transportation, and
distribution networks. Mexican DTOs and criminal groups are using these networks
to distribute crystal methamphetamine in areas of the country where the drug was
previously available only in limited quantities or not at all. Asian criminal
groups also will contribute to the growing availability of crystal
methamphetamine due to their increasing involvement in distributing the drug in
areas other than Hawaii and the West Coast. As the availability of crystal
methamphetamine increases, a corresponding increase in the number of abusers
will likely occur. The fact that the drug commands a significantly higher price
than powdered methamphetamine is not likely to slow demand for the drug.
