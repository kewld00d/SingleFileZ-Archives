"This is my list. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
My list is my best friend. It is my life. I must master it as I must master my life.
Without me, my list is useless. Without my list, I am useless."

Oh look, its yet another list of OSINT resources..
Since I do mainly do OSINT work for a living, you can imagine that I have accumulated a huge amount of resources and tools to assist me in locating certain information about certain things over the years. Figured I should share them in a mostly organized fashion, because sharing is caring right?
These lists are currently still a work in progress! It was going to take ages to write so I've decided to just publish what I already have and continue to push updates on the live versions. So stay tuned for more.
