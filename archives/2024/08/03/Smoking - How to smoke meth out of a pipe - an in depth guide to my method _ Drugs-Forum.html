Hello again, Friends. If you would like to skip straight to the guide, you can just start reading once you come across the bold lettering. If you would like to know a little bit about why I decided to make this thread, go ahead and continue reading for a small backstory.

I've been lurking on this forum for quite a while, up until I recently decided to make an account so that I can contribute my 2 cents on things. During this time, I read a lot of threads about how to properly smoke or what is the "right" way to do it. Although, after reading most of these threads, I still felt like I was missing some kind of information. So I made my account here and posted my first thread about how to properly smoke.

Now, a little while after posting that thread, getting some great responses, experimenting with different mentioned techniques as well as my own, buying different rigs/setups to see what worked best with multiple/different batches of pookie (so as to try the same technique across multiple batches that will all smoke differently), I feel as though I have really nailed down how I smoke to achieve above average results at the bare minimum. I am in no way trying to put myself on some kind of a high horse, I know that everyone has there own way and this is just mine. But I do feel that I tend to get higher, waste less, and burn the shit less than most of the people I smoke with at this point. Although this could just be because I smoke with half-ass smokers and don't know it, I'll just continue to think I'm decent at this whole thing for the sake of this thread.
(also know that I truly despise having to come up with different names to call meth. The only reason I generally try to do this is because I try to make an effort to not repeat the same word too many times in a post, or at least a paragraph. So for the sake of me, I'm just going to refer to it as "Funk" for now, which is partially cause I just think that's funny name for it haha)

So without rambling on any further, below I will be describing the methods and equipment that I use in order to achieve the best results when smoking that funk (In my experience).

Section 1 - Setup

This is honestly one of the most important sections to this guide. I can not stress enough how much the different things I'm going to describe here will effect the way your funk smokes.

A) Your pipe.
- Personally, I use a blue dot "oil burner". I do this because the glass is much thicker hence more durable (and I've dropped that thing more times then you could possibly imagine), and also because I can control the heat better which is also an effect of having the thicker glass. I also tend to use a larger pipe than most people. To give you an idea, my bowl is roughly the size of a ping-pong ball.

B) If you already have a pipe, make sure that it's clean.
- The best way that I've found to just at least make sure that the bowl is clean enough that you can drop some funk in there and smoke it without getting anything burnt mixed in, is if you take a torch lighter, turn the flame adjustment all the way up, and then put the flame on the bowl to where the inner of the two flames the torch produces is about 1/8 of an inch away from the glass. Then just move the flame around the bowl and torch all spots on it. You may see the old funk turn bright red and get scared thinking it's gonna blow up in your hand, but I assure you that if you hold the heat on it for a second or two after it turns red, it will just disintegrate. Do this until the glass is pretty uniformly clean and then let it cool. Keep in mind that after doing this your glass is going to be insanely hot, so make sure you either set it on something that's not going to burn (gently so you don't dent the glass since it's hot), or plan on holding it for a while. This cleaning method can be done on pipes that have thinner glass, but I would not hold the flame as close and pay very close attention to what I'm doing.
(I would also very much like to stress that it's incredibly important that you fully clean your pipe every time you load another bowl, no matter how dirty it is or not. I have had many a bowl not go the way I wanted simply because there was just a little bit of brown in there. Don't be lazy, just clean it.)

C) Your heat source.
- I will always recommend a torch lighter all day, every day. Some might call me crazy for this, and that's understandable because if you don't know how to smoke whilst operating a torch, you're gonna have a bad time. The key elements are how you use it (I'll get into that in the actual smoking section), as well as the way the torch itself is made (more particularly what it's flame is like).
My personal favorite torch of mine to use, is a very basic, single flame, Eagle Torch. It's very durable, can get very hot and be basically unaffected, and it has flame that is slightly wider in diameter than most of the other pocket sized single flames I see. This is good because using my method, you will be able to not only have more heat dispersion across your glass, but you'll also be able to focus more on actually using the heat from the flame as apposed to the flame itself.

D) You will obviously need some Funk.
- Once you have all of these things, proceed to the next section.

Section 2 - Smoking

Here I will go through all of the steps that I perform when loading a new bowl as well as taking a hit, in order.

Step 1) Loading the bowl.
- There are many mixed opinions on how much Funk to throw in a bowl. Personally, I usually throw in anywhere between .4 and a half gram. That seems like a lot to most, but keep in mind I will have that one bowl going and be gacked for about a day and a half. That is without burning it, and without worrying about having to clean my pipe again and loading up another bowl. I find that when I load more in, I get much larger hits, and I get much higher. Your funk will also probably do it's first meltdown better if you try to put similar sized rocks in there as well. Although having similar rocks at one time isn't the most crucial thing in the world, it definitely doesn't hurt.

Step 2) Melting it down.
- Now that we're getting into the part about using the torch, I want to say that I never touch either the outside or the inside flame to the glass while there's funk in there, and I usually have the adjustment set so that the tip of the outer flame is about an inch away from the base of the inner flame. Once you have your Funk in the bowl, go ahead and start circling the perimeter of the little pile of it slowly, with the tip of the outer blue flame about an inch or an inch and half away. It will take some time to melt down, although if you feel that you're holding it so far that some of the Funk is recrystallizing, feel free to move slightly closer. Just maintain as much distance as you can. Once it starts smoking, you should have a pretty decent puddle rolling. Twist your pipe side to side and breathe in from the mouth piece slowly. Continue to spin, breathe, and heat just until all of the crystals are melted down all the way. Once that happens take it off of the heat and slowly roll the pipe side to side while the Funk in there recrystallizes, letting it go about as far up each side of the bowl to make a sideways parenthesis symbol, or if you looked at it like a clock, about 4 and 8 at most.

Step 3) Taking a hit. (I would like to ask that especially in this section, you make sure to have a good understanding of what to do when according to these steps when trying my method. As I said before, to the untrained operator using a torch can potentially not go very well in the burning department if you mess up too bad. And nobody wants that )

- Alright. At this point we've gone over a lot of basics, and some not so difficult things that don't take too long to master, but now it's time for the real deal.
In an attempt to make this step as easy to read/follow along with as possible, I'm going to create another series of steps that are more detailed, with a "bullet points" version following that you can (hopefully) follow along with as you smoke, if you'd like to.

Step 3.1 - Light your torch and assure the flame is adjusted accordingly to how I described in "Step 2"

Step 3.2 - Place the flame at about the same distance as seen in "Step 2) Melting it down." and again, slowly trace the perimeter of your, what is right now, crystallized puddle. While doing this, be sure to keep the flame the same distance away from the glass the entire time you're "outlining" the puddle. An easy way to do this is to hold the torch so the flame is pointing straight up in the air and move the pipe as apposed to the former. (Pro-Tip #1 - I actually put the whole pipe above my head while I do this so I can see things better)

Step 3.3 - Right now you should be holding your flame around your bowl and be making it trace the perimeter of your puddle in some way or another. If you haven't already, you will start to see the bottom "layer" of your puddle melt. Continue to outline the puddle until the Funk liquefies enough to start moving back and forth across he bowl if you were to twist the pipe side to side. This will probably be when about half of your Funky puddle is melted down. What to do with the funk when it gets to this point is where most people and I differ in opinion. But trust me, if you perfect this part, you will be satisfied with your hit, every time.

Step 3.4 - So your puddle just started rolling, and you're starting to see some smoke. Even though it's awfully tempting, wait just a tad more to take any of it in. Instead, use this time that the bowl isn't absolutely filled with smoke (vision is key!) as an opportunity to make sure that the puddle is sitting nicely right in the middle of the bowl, directly below the carb hole on top, and remember that at this point you should still be outlining the puddle.

Step 3.5 - The puddle is mostly if not all liquid by now, is smoking a little, and you're probably starting to get a little bit concerned about burning your Funk, aren't you? Don't worry, your Funk is gonna be just fine, you just need to be vigilant about how your puddle is acting and watch for the signs I described at the beginning of this step. If you're here, then take the flame completely away from the bowl, exhale the majority of your breath outside of the pipe while using the tail end of your exhale to blow through pipe which will cause the puddle to start vaporizing like crazy. You only want to exhale for about 1/2 to 1 second. At that point you'll start inhaling which I'll talk about a little in the next step.

Step 3.6 - The first important thing to remember about this step is that all the while you're inhaling, you need to twist the pipe back and forth. Make an effort to keep the pipe horizontal while you're doing this, I've found it to produce the best results (Although you will more than likely find that your natural tendency is to hold it at a slight downward angle, and this is fine. The point is less to hold it completely level, and more about making sure that you stay conscious of not holding it at too much of a downward angle, as this will make it so that your Funk does not roll around the bowl correctly). You'll want to twist the pipe about the same amount as in "Step 1".
When you inhale, you need to do it very slowly and gently. I'm not saying to go as slow as is humanly possible for you, but don't hit it like you're trying to smoke pretty much anything else one might smoke. Take a deep breath as if you're stressed and trying to control your breathing to calm down. As you're inhaling you'll see all the smoke coming off of the puddle that you're taking in. But soon, the amount of smoke being produced will start to decrease more and more, so then what do you do?
Well at this point you have 2 options. You can either decide that you've already had a big enough hit and you don't think you can take much more (happens to me a lot at the beginning of one of my phat bowls ), or you can make that Funk start smoking again. If you choose the former, congratulations, you just took a hit using my method and I hope it worked great! If you go with the latter, then please read on to the next step.

Step 3.7 - In order to make the puddle start smoking again mid hit, firstly, you have to start heating it again at the right time. In my experience, I would say that this is right around when you see that your smoke production has decreased by give or take about half of when you started to inhale. Once you've noticed those signs (again, vision is key!), go ahead and move your torch flame back under the puddle. Except this time you're gonna keep the tip of the flame anywhere from a quarter inch (if not, ever so slightly closer but again not touching the flame to the glass) to about a half of an inch away. As your flame is under the puddle make sure to continue spinning the bowl at a slower rate than before, and while following your Funky puddle with said flame, move flame back and forth in small circular motions in order to cover the entire area (not just perimeter this time) of your puddle. This is performed as a very quick motion, and you should only keep the flame on there just until your smoke starts going the way you like again. At that point just rinse and repeat taking the flame on and off as I just explained until, A. You run out of breath and need to let your hit out. Or B. You're starting to burn your Funk.
The two main causes of burning that Funky Goodness when using this method, are how long/much heat you're putting into that Funk when you're re-applying your flame to continue your hit midway, and how long it's taking you overall to complete your hit. This is because the more times that you reapply heat to your puddle, your bowl in it's entirety heats up. This is detrimental because Funk smokes most when it is cooling down, not heating up (this is why I focus intently on heating the puddle until it's moving and then some. It packs heat in the spot where the puddle is, but then when the puddle is moved away from that heat, it starts to smoke like a volcano).
So again, be vigilant of how your puddle is acting. If it seems like even though you apply more heat in what looks like/is the correct spot, chances are that the entire glass bowl is just too hot overall for the Funk to cool down the way you need it to. At that point, you can either wait for the Funk to recrystallize or, if you're feeling ballsy enough, grab a slightly damp rag (wet, but dry enough so that no water comes out when you squeeze it) and gently run it across outer surface of the bowl to achieve instant cool down. (Be careful using the rag, as there is a pretty good chance that you're pipe could shatter on you from changing temperature so rapidly. I'm by no means saying I don't do it occasionally or that it doesn't do what it's supposed to. Just please, be careful)

And lastly for this step will be (Pro-Tip #2 - Take a second to identify which hand you prefer to hold your torch with when smoking. If your bowl starts to become foggy and hard to see into, a quick fix is to use the outer blue flame of your torch to (De-Fog?)/clean at least the same side of the bowl as your dominant hand that holds the torch (just be sure to do it quickly and not melt any of the actual Funk. The reason for only really needing to do one side, is that I find that as I'm inhaling, I tend to tilt my head to the same side that I'm holding my torch with and look inside the bowl. As I mentioned before, vision is key. And if you want to properly take control of your puddle of Funk, it's going to make things a lot easier if you have a little window that allows you to see what you're doing.)

Step 2/A - Smoking (Bullet points)

1. - Ensure that bowl is 100% clean.
2. - Load bowl.
3. - Adjust torch flame height.
4. - Light flame and circle around perimeter of Funk slowly.
5. - Once the Funk melts most of the way down, position in middle bottom of bowl and heat for another .5 - 1 second.
6. - Remove flame, exhaust end of exhale into pipe, then start slowly exhaling, all while twisting the pipe slowly.
7. - If/When Funk is smoking at about half as strong as when you first inhaled, put the flame on again. This time slightly closer and move flame quickly back and forth across entire puddle, all while still spinning (slightly slower).
8. - Repeat re-heating as necessary, and continue to inhale throughout your hit.

Step 3 - Upkeep

- Maintaining good habits regarding the cleanliness, maintenence, and overall quality of all your gear/tools is extremely important to achieve great results. For instance, If you had a torch that decided it wanted to have a mind of it's own and automatically adjusted it's own flame while it's lit you are more than likely going to burn your Funk, and as I stated before, You're gonna have a bad time.

Conclusion/Final Thoughts
I would like to go ahead and thank anyone who has read up to this point, and I hope that the knowledge I've shared here will help someone in some way. Whether it's an experienced user, or someone who's just starting out, if I can help you learn something new and useful then I have in fact, achieved my goal.

Cheers ~

Great guide, thanks for writing it up.

Would it be possible to take pictures of the lighter you use and the distances you're recommending? For those of us not in the USA, it's difficult to visualise how far an inch is.

@Rogatien I apologize for the late response. I will try to post some pictures at some point later on today. If it's any help for the time being until then, 1 inch measures up to roughly 2.5 Centimeters.

Also I probably should have mentioned this in the guide, but when I'm twisting a bowl, I don't make exact calculations as to how far the flame has to be i.e. I don't look at it and think "Well, looks like I'm off by about 3/16 of an inch" haha. As far as being that precise goes I think it really comes more down to your own judgement, and a big reason for that is because pretty much every batch of Funk you get is more than likely going to melt, burn, vaporize, take a different amount of heat, etc. than the last batch you had (at least by a little bit). It also depends a lot on the thickness and quality of your glass, which as you probably know, comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes.

I'm not trying to discredit the numbers that I put up there, because I do feel that in most situations they are quite accurate. My goal in writing this was to give a precise explanation, so that you may take this method and build upon it with your own technique.
Thank you for reading

@planetarypupils thanks. Yeah, my depth perception is dodgy at best, so if I'm chemically enhanced, it goes right out the window.  Hence why I need all the distance assistance I can get. But, since reading your OP and through extensive practical research (what? it was for science), I've managed to get to the point that I can smoke a bowl with no burns and almost no brown stuff at all. I'm pretty pleased with that. Now I'm just working on getting consistent big clouds, because I think they're tremendous.

Thank you for the in-depth guide. Even though I’m somewhat experienced, I enjoy reading about someone else’s thought process and the shared goal of the perfect hit. 

If you’re going to post pics, can you also put one up of the “blue-dot oil burner?” I’m not familiar with the term and I feel like I’ve tried nearly every pipe that’s available for me to buy. All in service of the quest for the maximal hit. So I’m interested in seeing yours.

Excellent break down. The only thing I would disagree with is the wet rage. I literally cool my pipe down right away with a rag every single time. Now I don't know if I'm just lucky or what but I've never once had a pipe shatter on me from it. Usually what I do is as soon as I'm done taking my hit I gently rub the bowl where the puddle is with the rag. I start off doing it just a bit and when it's cracked back I just rub the whole bowl down to cool it right off so I can put it away. The first time I ever smoked I even put buddies pipe in the freezer and it was all good.

@RogatienAlso I probably should have mentioned this in the guide, but when I'm twisting a bowl, I don't make exact calculations as to how far the flame has to be i.e. I don't look at it and think "Well, looks like I'm off by about 3/16 of an inch" haha. As far as being that precise goes I think it really comes more down to your own judgementClick to expand...

You don't?!?! You don't whip out your ruler and check for accuracy?! What kind of lazy meth user are you? Lol (joking) ... I'm just poking fun, you know, because we usually like everything to be perfectly precise 

Good read by the way  As someone else mentioned, it's always good to get insight as to how others use theirs. I will, however, agree that 

A. your 4/5 pt (.4-.5g) bowl load is high!!! You cra-zay-zee! I have actually only ever seen one pipe that could handle that amount here in Aus. Even with what we have as standard, when you overload it, you get very little vapour, but if yours can handle it then I would agree that its much more convenient. I mean who wants to be stuck in a public bathroom somewhere getting nervous as frick loading up a pipe?! Getting paranoid that others are hearing the 'click click click' of the jet lighter... I hated that...! hahah

B. Also, torch lighters ... for me I don't think they are for beginners. I know I know, how else do they get the practice? .... well, I dunno, but even to this day, 17 years after first commencing (and most importantly, if I still did it - too old now ), I would suggest that 
(i) from loading a new bowl all the way down to almost finished, use a bic lighter and then 
(ii) use a torch to get the last bits, get the residue off the bowl at the very minimum so it can be cleaned and reloaded. 

Plus with the bic lighters, it lasts a bit longer too... Even though I don't buy anymore (well, very infrequently), I know that US prices are still insanely cheap compared to Aus prices! But also, in saying this, I think this part is a deeply personal preference too. 

C. Totally agree with your 'damp' rag theory. I actually have lost pipes to cloths that were too wet. Well, it was a combo of an old pipe, hot, rubbed across a very wet rag ... Kaboom! In the end what i used to use (despite being male) was the cotton cloth strips that come with leg wax ... lol. I would layer 2 or 3 down, fold a few times and dampen. I choose cotton because it's not synthetic and is pretty burn proof, plus it holds water well and is good at removing heat quick. Some materials you can find get burnt onto the outside of a pipe. If that happened, I would use a razor to scrap off. 

I have to say, Oh the memories. I believe there is great truth to what someone once told me, that pipe smokers actually have two addictions .. the meth and the pipe, and the pipe is usually the stronger one. Based on the fact I had two pipes for 13 years, which is unheard of, could be evidence of that. I owed this to a strict maintenance regime lol ... oh, and not lending them out. I'm sorry, these are my babies tho! (or were, they died a little while ago ... sad times).

Also you post shows that proper pipe maintenance is really an art form. Yes, anyone can be one of those icky junkies that have broken, cracked pipes with soot marks all over them, thrown in the bottom of their bag willy nilly! But to maintain is definitely a display of love! Lol ...

TY

Cheers

@phxbot Personally I don't really hold it in at all. I take my hit and then exhale pretty much right after I'm done inhaling, with maybe a second or two delay at the most before I let out the smoke.

Based off of most of the opinions that I've read/heard it seems to be that all of the Funk that gets you high is absorbed through your lungs almost instantaneously after you inhale it. I've also found this to hold true in my own experience.

Usually what I do is as soon as I'm done taking my hit I gently rub the bowl where the puddle is with the rag. I start off doing it just a bit and when it's cracked back I just rub the whole bowl down to cool it right off so I can put it away.Click to expand...

i've had it happen both ways...never had a problem with my ex's piece and wet rag, then got my own piece and shattered it the first time i used it by cooling with a wet rag (!). was almost mortally afraid to use a rag that was even the slightest bit damp for the longest time after that.

i've figured out the trick - and this part varies a little depending on the glass, but unless the glass is super-thin (and i mean SUPER-thin) it shouldn't be too big a deal - is to not use the rag immediately, but rather to wait a few seconds after i've removed the flame from the bowl. also i inhale as i use the rag, which draws in cool surrounding air and helps cool the glass where the rag isn't touching as well to help minimize temperature differences (cool it too fast and it can shock and break, but also if you have one piece of glass with too great a temperature variation from one area to a neighboring area).

also damp is the operative word, as i've found rags that are too wet are more likely to cool the glass too rapidly, while dry rags don't cool it enough and the dope will continue to "cook" or even start to burn earlier in the sesh - remember, water is a MUCH better conductor of heat than air or cloth. a good rule of thumb is as long as it's not sopping/dripping wet; i usually wring it out (back on itself to catch the water and spread the damp around rather than have wet and dry spots) and make sure there's no more water squeezing out and i'm good. thicker rags, like hand towels, seem to be better too than small, thin washcloths or t-shirt pieces.

so basically, flame away, finish my hit, if i think the bowl's still extra hot i'll lightly brush the side with the rag, if it sizzles i wait a few more seconds until no more sizzle when i brush it, and then start on the sides/top (already a little cooler since no hot dope touching those parts, so less prone to shock) and work my way down to the bottom of the bowl while continuing the inhale and draw air through. i generally can help speed the cracking back too, to minimize loss through continued vaping.....  it sounds complicated and long and drawn out, but it really only takes a few seconds all in all with the rag. after that you're just holding the piece in the rag.

to be perfectly accurate, any cloud you see when you exhale is just vaporized dope that didn't get absorbed - i.e., wasted dope. so unless you're exhaling into a blowback pipe (which if anyone knows of a design or TEK for one, please send it my way lol...) it's less wasteful to hold it in. i rarely have any vapor come out when i exhale (more successful at this with a bong than a pipe, dunno why, but also more success getting high with the bong these days than the pipe for some reason), and ever since i started holding my hits like this i noticed the same amount of dope would have the same effects within the same amount of time but i'd be using a LOT less, so my money ended up going further as my dope started lasting longer 

the first bit that touches your lungs absorbs immediately, yes, but it has to get absorbed and out of the way before the rest in your lungs can settle onto the surface inside your lungs to also get absorbed. kinda like when you dump a big spoonful of sugar on top of a glass of iced tea; it doesn't all get wet and start dissolving at once, but rather the stuff on the bottom has to get wet and dissolve and get out of the way for the stuff above it to be able to reach the surface of the tea.

i know the huge clouds look bitchin' and all, but yeah, i prefer to get my money's worth  (and lemme just tell ya how fucking SPUN i got when i first started holding like that, holy shitballs man.......)

i've had it happen both ways...never had a problem with my ex's piece and wet rag, then got my own piece and shattered it the first time i used it by cooling with a wet rag (!). was almost mortally afraid to use a rag that was even the slightest bit damp for the longest time after that.Click to expand...

Literally the same night I made the comment about it never happening to me, it happened. I felt like such an idiot, and it was a good quality pipe too. Lol

What is the best way to smoke and not burn it using glass that isn't thick with a regular lighter?

You're essentially just going to apply all of the same concepts that I've covered in my guide, but on a little bit different scale. The differences being that 1. You will be using a piece with thinner glass, therefore the glass will heat up faster, furthermore heating up your Funk quicker. Although on the flip side of this, 2. is that you're using a lighter that does not produce as much heat as a torch would, in which case everything will take longer to heat up.

Hello there! I recently saw a pipe that had 2 bowls side by side. The pipe looked like a slingshot. Has anyone else ever seen this? More importantly has anyone ever used one? If you have I have a could questions. How are they in regards to practicality? Do you just heat one bowl at a time or both simultaneously? If you heated both bowls at the same time I'd imagine huge hits could be achieved is this accurate? And also any other info on these pipes is appreciated because if they are practical I'll have to pick one up.

Poe-640, the side by side double-bowl pipe is a gimmick without much real world benefit, in my opinion. When I first saw one I bought it thinking it was unlikely I'd double my hit, but I was hoping I might get close. No deal. It's also hard to use because with a 10-2 motion one bowl is going up and the other down. I didn't keep that pipe for long.

There are some novelty pipes worth having--my favorite of all was a super-thick handmade piece that was almost a foot long, my best friend has a twisty-stem pipe that he swears by because it's easier to hold and twirl. This pipe is not one of those.

I assumed it wouldn't be a worth while pipe to pick up lol thanks for getting back to me it's always nice to get a review/opinion of a pipe from someone who's actually tried one out or in your case owned one.
I'd think that if you could get both bowl rolling simultaneously one might get a hit that's "twice as big" but that'd be nearly impossible and your still smoking twice as much product.
You seem to have knowledge on diffrent types of pipes. What is your ideal thickness for a good regular use pipe. I'm thinking of just getting a 3 or 5 pack of "oil fragrance burners" online. They sell for like 10$. So instead of me having to drive an hour away to the nearest head shop to get a new piece and spending 5$ on one piece and another 10$ on gas I'll have 5 pipes of good quality and if one cracks or breaks i have a replacement. I've seen lots of sizes but the one that I'm leaning towards is 4 inches long with a decent sized bubble and they claim the glass is 2mm. Does this sound like the decent pipe? 
Now Because im new to smoking I can't really picture how thick that really is or if that's a ideal thickness if I want my pipe for have some longevity I a 5 pack is about $9.50 with free shipping so if they don't last super long I'll have some back ups or replacements but some insight would be helpful.
Also do you know anything about warblers or meth bongs/bubblers? Such as their efficiency and if they waste product stuff like that. 
I know that I made a homemade warbler with a pipe rigged up to a downstem and angled adapter that let me use my pipe independently if I wasn't at home or if I wanted I could connect it to the ghetto rig. 
I know that you get much larger hits but that also means you go through more of your stuff faster and I felt like the hits felt somehow cleaner and I thought I got higher than usual but I was taking much larger hits so it's hard to say if it was actually a result of the pipe or just using more faster. 
I know that after doing a lot of research that the vaporized meth isn't very water soluble and isn't actually in the water very long so the amount that is actually lost in the water is very little and drinking the water isn't worth it as it doesn't actually contain very much meth unless you smoke a large amount through the same water or smoke through the same water very often for a long time. 
Lastly I've heard warm water makes the water even more unlikely to absorb some of the meth as it bubbles through is their any truth to this? Anyway I can do reaserch all night or untill I'm blue in the face but I think real experiences from other users is much more useful. Mostly because a lot of shit looks like it'll work great on paper but dosent perform as well in real life scenarios. So any help is appreciated and thanks again for helping out with the other pipe I was questioning.

What is your ideal thickness for a good regular use pipe? Medium-thick, because I use a torch more often than not, and I'm used to how pipes of this size tend to behave.

I've seen lots of sizes but the one that I'm leaning towards is 4 inches long with a decent sized bubble and they claim the glass is 2mm. Does this sound like the decent pipe? It does sound decent--2 mm is that "medium-thick" glass that I like. I'm assuming the description is for the tube itself and not the bubble. For me, I would get a six inch rather than a four inch pipe - much easier on the depth perception.
...
Also do you know anything about warblers or meth bongs/bubblers? I've used them. Others on here know more about them than I do. Most of the time I prefer it straight from the pipe.
.....
Lastly I've heard warm water makes the water even more unlikely to absorb some of the meth as it bubbles through is their any truth to this? This I do know: Yes true. The solubility of a gas goes up as the temperature of a liquid goes down. The difference between cold and warm tap water may not be noticeable, but it should be there.

Hope that helps,

It did help a lot! Thanks for the tips!

--- Double Post Merged, Nov 21, 2017 ---

Also there's a lot of conflicting opinions on if holding it in for more than 10secs after you finish inhaling is more efficient and absorbs from of the actual meth. So most will saw no need to hold it in for too long but a little bit and I think it's absorbing a small bit more but not much.
What I want to know is if there's a way to collect the meth what's left over in the cloud you get off of solid hit. Would the old fashioned ballon meyhod work I havnt tryidd thaypainfully

--- Double Post Merged, Nov 21, 2017 ---

Oops I don't k ow why I can't edit anything. I meant would it work? I havnt tried any method yet but should try to find a realiable method list it so I can minimize loss!

Excellent break down. The only thing I would disagree with is the wet rage. I literally cool my pipe down right away with a rag every single time. Now I don't know if I'm just lucky or what but I've never once had a pipe shatter on me from it. Usually what I do is as soon as I'm done taking my hit I gently rub the bowl where the puddle is with the rag. I start off doing it just a bit and when it's cracked back I just rub the whole bowl down to cool it right off so I can put it away. The first time I ever smoked I even put buddies pipe in the freezer and it was all good.Click to expand...

Cooling glass down to quick is not good, first of all you need to heat your glass evenely to prevent thermal stress. Heat or cold doesnt cause the stress, its when the temp varies.So when you use a rag to cool down your pipe, the outside of the glass cools down quicker then the inside. Your glass might not shatter, but your creating microscopic stress fractures, witch cause glass to distribute heat more unevenly'
Never cool your glass quickly thats not my opinion thats fact .
