15.1 Introduction
This chapter describes SVG's declarative filter effects
feature set, which when combined with the 2D power of SVG can
describe much of the common artwork on the Web in such a way
that client-side generation and alteration can be performed
easily. In addition, the ability to apply filter effects to SVG
graphics elements
and container
elements helps to maintain the semantic structure of the
document, instead of resorting to images which aside from
generally being a fixed resolution tend to obscure the original
semantics of the elements they replace. This is especially true
for effects applied to text.
A filter effect consists of a series of graphics operations
that are applied to a given source
graphic to produce a modified graphical result. The
result of the filter effect is rendered to the target device
instead of the original source graphic. The following
illustrates the process:

View this example as SVG
(SVG-enabled browsers only)
Filter effects are defined by ‘filter’ elements. To apply a
filter effect to a graphics element or a
container
element, you set the value of the ‘filter’ property on the given
element such that it references the filter effect.
Each ‘filter’ element contains a set
of filter primitives as its children.
Each filter primitive performs a single fundamental graphical
operation (e.g., a blur or a lighting effect) on one or more
inputs, producing a graphical result. Because most of the
filter primitives represent some form of image processing, in
most cases the output from a filter primitive is a single RGBA
image.
The original source graphic or the result from a filter
primitive can be used as input into one or more other filter
primitives. A common application is to use the source graphic
multiple times. For example, a simple filter could replace one
graphic by two by adding a black copy of original source
graphic offset to create a drop shadow. In effect, there are
now two layers of graphics, both with the same original source
graphics.
When applied to container elements
such as ‘g’, the ‘filter’ property applies to the
contents of the group as a whole. The group's children do not
render to the screen directly; instead, the graphics commands
necessary to render the children are stored temporarily.
Typically, the graphics commands are executed as part of the
processing of the referenced ‘filter’ element via use of the
keywords SourceGraphic or SourceAlpha. Filter effects can
be applied to container elements
with no content (e.g., an empty ‘g’ element), in which case the
SourceGraphic or SourceAlpha consist of a
transparent black rectangle that is the size of the filter effects region.
Sometimes filter primitives result in undefined pixels. For
example, filter primitive ‘feOffset’ can shift an image
down and to the right, leaving undefined pixels at the top and
left. In these cases, the undefined pixels are set to
transparent black.
15.2 An example
The following shows an example of a filter effect.

Filter primitive ‘feGaussianBlur’ takes input
SourceAlpha, which is the alpha
channel of the source graphic. The result is stored in a
temporary buffer named "blur". Note that "blur" is used as
input to both filter primitives 2 and 3.Filter primitive ‘feOffset’ takes buffer
"blur", shifts the result in a positive direction in both x
and y, and creates a new buffer named "offsetBlur". The
effect is that of a drop shadow.Filter primitive ‘feSpecularLighting’, uses
buffer "blur" as a model of a surface elevation and generates
a lighting effect from a single point source. The result is
stored in buffer "specOut".Filter primitive ‘feComposite’ masks out the
result of filter primitive 3 by the original source graphics
alpha channel so that the intermediate result is no bigger
than the original source graphic.Filter primitive ‘feComposite’ composites the
result of the specular lighting with the original source
graphic.Filter primitive ‘feMerge’ composites two
layers together. The lower layer consists of the drop shadow
result from filter primitive 2. The upper layer consists of
the specular lighting result from filter primitive 5.
15.3 The ‘filter’ element
The description of the ‘filter’ element follows:
‘filter’Categories:NoneContent model:Any number of the following elements, in any order:
descriptive elements  — , , filter primitive elements  — , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ‘animate’‘set’Attributes:core attributes  — , , , presentation attributes  — , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , xlink attributes  — , , , , , , ‘class’‘style’‘externalResourcesRequired’‘x’‘y’‘width’‘height’‘filterRes’‘filterUnits’‘primitiveUnits’‘xlink:href’DOM Interfaces:SVGFilterElement

Attribute definitions:
filterUnits = "userSpaceOnUse
| objectBoundingBox"See Filter effects
region.primitiveUnits =
"userSpaceOnUse | objectBoundingBox"Specifies the coordinate system for the various length
values within the filter primitives and for the attributes
that define the filter
primitive subregion.
If primitiveUnits="userSpaceOnUse", any
length values within the filter definitions represent
values in the current user coordinate system in place at
the time when the ‘filter’ element is
referenced (i.e., the user coordinate system for the
element referencing the ‘filter’ element via a ‘filter’ property).
If primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox",
then any length values within the filter definitions
represent fractions or percentages of the bounding box on
the referencing element (see Object bounding box
units). Note that if only one number was specified in a &lt;number-optional-number&gt; value
this number is expanded out before the ‘primitiveUnits’ computation takes place.

If attribute ‘primitiveUnits’
is not specified, then the effect is as if a value of userSpaceOnUse were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.x = "&lt;coordinate&gt;"See Filter effects
region.y = "&lt;coordinate&gt;"See Filter effects
region.width = "&lt;length&gt;"See Filter effects
region.height = "&lt;length&gt;"See Filter effects
region.filterRes = "&lt;number-optional-number&gt;"See Filter effects
region.xlink:href = "&lt;iri&gt;"An IRI
reference to another ‘filter’ element within the
current SVG document fragment. Any attributes which are
defined on the referenced ‘filter’ element which are not
defined on this element are inherited by this element. If
this element has no defined filter nodes, and the
referenced element has defined filter nodes (possibly due
to its own ‘xlink:href’ attribute),
then this element inherits the filter nodes defined from
the referenced ‘filter’
element. Inheritance can be indirect to an arbitrary level;
thus, if the referenced ‘filter’ element inherits
attributes or its filter node specification due to its own
‘xlink:href’ attribute, then the
current element can inherit those attributes or filter node
specifications.
Animatable:
yes.

Properties
inherit into the ‘filter’
element from its ancestors; properties do not inherit
from the element referencing the ‘filter’ element.
‘filter’ elements are
never rendered directly; their only usage is as something that
can be referenced using the ‘filter’ property. The ‘display’ property does not apply
to the ‘filter’ element;
thus, ‘filter’ elements are
not directly rendered even if the ‘display’ property is set to a
value other than none, and
‘filter’ elements are
available for referencing even when the ‘display’ property on the ‘filter’ element or any of its
ancestors is set to none.
15.4 The ‘filter’
property
The description of the ‘filter’ property is as follows:

‘filter’
Value:  &lt;funciri&gt; | none | 
inheritInitial:  noneApplies to:  container
elements (except ‘mask’) and graphics
elementsInherited:  noPercentages:  N/AMedia:  visualAnimatable:  yes

&lt;funciri&gt;An Functional IRI
reference to a ‘filter’ element which
defines the filter effects that shall be applied to this
element.noneDo not apply any filter effects to this element.
15.5 Filter effects region
A ‘filter’ element can define a
region on the canvas to which a given filter effect applies and
can provide a resolution for any intermediate continuous tone
images used to process any raster-based filter primitives. The
‘filter’ element has the
following attributes which work together to define the filter
effects region:
‘filterUnits’
Defines the coordinate system for attributes ‘x’, ‘y’,
‘width’ and ‘height’.
If filterUnits="userSpaceOnUse",
‘x’, ‘y’, ‘width’ and ‘height’ represent
values in the current user coordinate system in place at the time
when the ‘filter’ is referenced (i.e., the user
coordinate system for the element referencing the ‘filter’
via a ‘filter’ property).
If filterUnits="objectBoundingBox",
then ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘width’ and ‘height’
represent fractions or percentages of the bounding box on the referencing
element (see Object bounding box units).

If attribute ‘filterUnits’ is not specified, then the effect
is if a value of 'objectBoundingBox'
were specified.
Animatable: yes.
‘x’, ‘y’, ‘width’ and ‘height’
These attributes define a rectangular region on the canvas to
which this filter applies.
The amount of memory and processing time required to apply
the filter are related to the size of this rectangle and the
‘filterRes’ attribute of the filter.
The coordinate system for these attributes depends on the
value for attribute ‘filterUnits’.
Negative values for ‘width’ or ‘height’ are an error
(see Error processing).
Zero values disable rendering of the element which referenced
the filter.
The bounds of this rectangle act as a hard clipping region for each
filter primitive
included with a given ‘filter’ element; thus, if
the effect of a given filter primitive would extend beyond
the bounds of the rectangle (this sometimes happens when
using a ‘feGaussianBlur’ filter
primitive with a very large ‘stdDeviation’),
parts of the effect will get clipped.
If ‘x’ or ‘y’ is not specified, the effect is as if a
value of -10% were specified.
If ‘width’ or ‘height’ is not specified, the effect is as if a
value of 120% were specified.
Animatable: yes.
‘filterRes’
This attribute takes the form x-pixels [y-pixels],
and indicates the width and height of the intermediate images in
pixels. If not provided, then the user agent will use reasonable values 
to produce a high-quality result on the output device.

Care should be taken when assigning a non-default value to
this attribute. Too small of a value may result in unwanted
pixelation in the result. Too large of a value may result in
slow processing and large memory usage.
Negative values are an error (see
Error processing).
Zero values disable rendering of the element which referenced
the filter.

Non-integer values are truncated, i.e rounded to the closest integer value towards zero.
Animatable: yes.

Note that both of the two possible value for ‘filterUnits’
(i.e., 'objectBoundingBox' and
'userSpaceOnUse') result in a filter
region whose coordinate system has its X-axis and Y-axis each
parallel to the X-axis and Y-axis, respectively, of the user
coordinate system for the element to which the filter will be
applied.
Sometimes implementers can achieve faster performance when
the filter region can be mapped directly to device pixels;
thus, for best performance on display devices, it is suggested
that authors define their region such that SVG user agent can
align the filter region pixel-for-pixel with the background. In
particular, for best filter effects performance, avoid rotating
or skewing the user coordinate system. Explicit values for
attribute ‘filterRes’ can either
help or harm performance. If ‘filterRes’ is smaller than the
automatic (i.e., default) filter resolution, then filter effect
might have faster performance (usually at the expense of
quality). If ‘filterRes’ is larger
than the automatic (i.e., default) filter resolution, then
filter effects performance will usually be slower.
It is often necessary to provide padding space because the
filter effect might impact bits slightly outside the
tight-fitting bounding box on a given object. For these
purposes, it is possible to provide negative percentage values
for ‘x’ and ‘y’, and percentages values greater than
100% for ‘width’ and ‘height’. This, for example, is
why the defaults for the filter effects region are x="-10%"
y="-10%" width="120%" height="120%".
15.6 Accessing the background image
Two possible pseudo input images for filter effects are BackgroundImage and BackgroundAlpha, which each
represent an image snapshot of the canvas under the filter
region at the time that the ‘filter’ element is invoked. BackgroundImage represents both the
color values and alpha channel of the canvas (i.e., RGBA pixel
values), whereas BackgroundAlpha
represents only the alpha channel.
Implementations of SVG user agents often will need to
maintain supplemental background image buffers in order to
support the BackgroundImage and
BackgroundAlpha pseudo input
images. Sometimes, the background image buffers will contain an
in-memory copy of the accumulated painting operations on the
current canvas.
Because in-memory image buffers can take up significant
system resources, SVG content must explicitly indicate to the
SVG user agent that the document needs access to the background
image before BackgroundImage and
BackgroundAlpha pseudo input
images can be used. The property which enables access to the
background image is ‘enable-background’, defined below:

‘enable-background’
Value:  accumulate | new [ &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt;
&lt;width&gt; &lt;height&gt; ] | 
inheritInitial:  accumulateApplies to:  container
elementsInherited:  noPercentages:  N/AMedia:  visualAnimatable:  no

‘enable-background’ is only
applicable to container elements
and specifies how the SVG user agents manages the accumulation
of the background image.
A value of new indicates two things:
It enables the ability of children of the current container element
to access the background image.It indicates that a new (i.e., initially transparent
black) background image canvas is established and that (in
effect) all children of the current container element
shall be rendered into the new background image canvas in
addition to being rendered onto the target device.
A meaning of enable-background: accumulate
(the initial/default value) depends on context:
If an ancestor container element
has a property value of enable-background: new, then all graphics elements
within the current container element
are rendered both onto the parent container
element's background image canvas and onto the target
device.Otherwise, there is no current background image canvas,
so it is only necessary to render graphics elements
onto the target device. (No need to render to the background
image canvas.)
If a filter effect specifies either the BackgroundImage or the BackgroundAlpha pseudo input images
and no ancestor container element
has a property value of enable-background: new, then the
background image request is technically in error. Processing
will proceed without interruption (i.e., no error message) and
a transparent black image shall be provided in response to the
request.
The optional
&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;,&lt;width&gt;,&lt;height&gt;
parameters on the new value are
&lt;number&gt; values that indicate the
subregion of the container element's
user space where access
to the background image is allowed to happen. These parameters
enable the SVG user agent potentially to allocate smaller
temporary image buffers than the default values. Thus, the values
&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;,&lt;width&gt;,&lt;height&gt; act as a
clipping rectangle on the background image canvas. Negative
values for &lt;width&gt; or &lt;height&gt; are an error (see Error processing). If
more than zero but less than four of the values
&lt;x&gt;,&lt;y&gt;,&lt;width&gt; and &lt;height&gt; are
specified or if zero values are specified for &lt;width&gt; or
&lt;height&gt;, BackgroundImage
and BackgroundAlpha are
processed as if background image processing were not
enabled.
Assume you have an element E in the document and that E has
a series of ancestors A1 (its immediate parent),
A2, etc. (Note: A0 is E.) Each ancestor
Ai will have a corresponding temporary background
image offscreen buffer BUFi. The contents of the
background image available to a ‘filter’ referenced by E is
defined as follows:
Find the element Ai with the smallest
subscript i (including A0=E) for which the ‘enable-background’ property has
the value new. (Note: if
there is no such ancestor element, then there is no
background image available to E, in which case a transparent
black image will be used as E's background image.)For each Ai (from i=n to 1), initialize
BUFi to transparent black. Render all children of
Ai up to but not including Ai-1 into
BUFi. The children are painted, then filtered,
clipped, masked and composited using the various painting,
filtering, clipping, masking and object opacity settings on
the given child. Any filter effects, masking and group
opacity that might be set on Ai do not
apply when rendering the children of Ai into
BUFi.
(Note that for the case of A0=E, the graphical
contents of E are not rendered into BUF1 and thus
are not part of the background image available to E. Instead,
the graphical contents of E are available via the SourceGraphic and SourceAlpha pseudo input
images.)Then, for each Ai (from i=1 to n-1), composite
BUFi into BUFi+1.The accumulated result (i.e., BUFn) represents
the background image available to E.

enable-background-01 illustrates the rules for
background image processing.

&lt;/svg&gt;Example enable-background-01View this example as SVG (SVG-enabled browsers only)
The example above contains five parts, described as
follows:
The first set is the reference graphic. The reference
graphic consists of a red rectangle followed by a 50%
transparent ‘g’ element. Inside the ‘g’ is a green circle that
partially overlaps the rectangle and a a blue triangle that
partially overlaps the circle. The three objects are then
outlined by a rectangle stroked with a thin blue line. No
filters are applied to the reference graphic.The second set enables background image processing and
adds an empty ‘g’ element which invokes the
ShiftBGAndBlur filter. This filter takes the current
accumulated background image (i.e., the entire reference
graphic) as input, shifts its offscreen down, blurs it, and
then writes the result to the canvas. Note that the offscreen
for the filter is initialized to transparent black, which
allows the already rendered rectangle, circle and triangle to
show through after the filter renders its own result to the
canvas.The third set enables background image processing and
instead invokes the ShiftBGAndBlur filter on the inner ‘g’ element. The accumulated
background at the time the filter is applied contains only
the red rectangle. Because the children of the inner ‘g’ (i.e., the circle and
triangle) are not part of the inner ‘g’ element's background and
because ShiftBGAndBlur ignores SourceGraphic, the children of
the inner ‘g’ do not appear in the
result.The fourth set enables background image processing and
invokes the ShiftBGAndBlur on the ‘polygon’ element that draws
the triangle. The accumulated background at the time the
filter is applied contains the red rectangle plus the green
circle ignoring the effect of the ‘opacity’ property on the inner
‘g’ element. (Note that the
blurred green circle at the bottom does not let the red
rectangle show through on its left side. This is due to
ignoring the effect of the ‘opacity’ property.) Because the
triangle itself is not part of the accumulated background and
because ShiftBGAndBlur ignores SourceGraphic, the triangle
does not appear in the result.The fifth set is the same as the fourth except that
filter ShiftBGAndBlur_WithSourceGraphic is invoked instead of
ShiftBGAndBlur. ShiftBGAndBlur_WithSourceGraphic performs the
same effect as ShiftBGAndBlur, but then renders the
SourceGraphic on top of the shifted, blurred background
image. In this case, SourceGraphic is the blue triangle;
thus, the result is the same as in the fourth case except
that the blue triangle now appears.
15.7 Filter primitives overview
15.7.1 Overview
This section describes the various filter primtives that can
be assembled to achieve a particular filter effect.
Unless otherwise stated, all image filters operate on
premultiplied RGBA samples. Filters which work more naturally
on non-premultiplied data (feColorMatrix and
feComponentTransfer) will temporarily undo and redo
premultiplication as specified. All raster effect filtering
operations take 1 to N input RGBA images, additional attributes
as parameters, and produce a single output RGBA image.
The RGBA result from each filter primitive will be clamped
into the allowable ranges for colors and opacity values. Thus,
for example, the result from a given filter primitive will have
any negative color values or opacity values adjusted up to
color/opacity of zero.
The color space in which a particular filter primitive
performs its operations is determined by the value of property
‘color-interpolation-filters’ on
the given filter primitive. A different property, ‘color-interpolation’ determines
the color space for other color operations. Because these two
properties have different initial values (‘color-interpolation-filters’ has
an initial value of linearRGB
whereas ‘color-interpolation’ has an
initial value of sRGB), in some
cases to achieve certain results (e.g., when coordinating
gradient interpolation with a filtering operation) it will be
necessary to explicitly set ‘color-interpolation’ to linearRGB or ‘color-interpolation-filters’ to
sRGB on particular elements.
Note that the examples below do not explicitly set either ‘color-interpolation’ or ‘color-interpolation-filters’, so
the initial values for these properties apply to the
examples.
15.7.2 Common attributes
With the exception of the ‘in’ attribute, all of the following
attributes are available on all filter primitive elements:

Attribute definitions:
x = "&lt;coordinate&gt;"The minimum x coordinate for the subregion which
restricts calculation and rendering of the given filter
primitive. See filter
primitive subregion.
Animatable:
yes.y = "&lt;coordinate&gt;"The minimum y coordinate for the subregion which
restricts calculation and rendering of the given filter
primitive. See filter
primitive subregion.Animatable:
yes.width = "&lt;length&gt;"The width of the subregion which restricts calculation
and rendering of the given filter primitive. See filter
primitive subregion.
A negative value is an error (see Error processing).
A value of zero disables the effect of the given filter
primitive (i.e., the result is a transparent black
image).
Animatable:
yes.height = "&lt;length&gt;"The height of the subregion which restricts calculation
and rendering of the given filter primitive. See filter
primitive subregion.
A negative value is an error (see Error processing).
A value of zero disables the effect of the given filter
primitive (i.e., the result is a transparent black
image).
Animatable:
yes.result =
"&lt;filter-primitive-reference&gt;"Assigned name for this filter primitive. If supplied,
then graphics that result from processing this filter
primitive can be referenced by an ‘in’ attribute on a subsequent
filter primitive within the same ‘filter’ element. If no
value is provided, the output will only be available for
re-use as the implicit input into the next filter primitive
if that filter primitive provides no value for its ‘in’ attribute.
Note that a &lt;filter-primitive-reference&gt; is
not an XML ID; instead, a
&lt;filter-primitive-reference&gt; is only
meaningful within a given ‘filter’ element and thus
have only local scope. It is legal for the same
&lt;filter-primitive-reference&gt; to appear
multiple times within the same ‘filter’ element. When
referenced, the &lt;filter-primitive-reference&gt;
will use the closest preceding filter primitive with the
given result.
Animatable:
yes.in = "SourceGraphic | SourceAlpha | BackgroundImage |
BackgroundAlpha
| FillPaint | StrokePaint |
&lt;filter-primitive-reference&gt;"
Identifies input for the given filter primitive. The
value can be either one of six keywords or can be a
string which matches a previous ‘result’ attribute value
within the same ‘filter’ element. If no
value is provided and this is the first filter primitive,
then this filter primitive will use SourceGraphic as its input.
If no value is provided and this is a subsequent filter
primitive, then this filter primitive will use the result
from the previous filter primitive as its input.

If the value for ‘result’
appears multiple times within a given ‘filter’ element, then a
reference to that result will use the closest preceding
filter primitive with the given value for attribute ‘result’. Forward references to
results are an
error.

Definitions for the six keywords: 
SourceGraphicThis keyword represents the graphics
elements that were the original input into the ‘filter’ element. For
raster effects filter primitives, the graphics
elements will be rasterized into an initially clear
RGBA raster in image space. Pixels left untouched by
the original graphic will be left clear. The image is
specified to be rendered in linear RGBA pixels. The
alpha channel of this image captures any anti-aliasing
specified by SVG. (Since the raster is linear, the
alpha channel of this image will represent the exact
percent coverage of each pixel.)SourceAlphaThis keyword represents the graphics
elements that were the original input into the ‘filter’ element. SourceAlpha has all of the
same rules as SourceGraphic except that
only the alpha channel is used. The input image is an
RGBA image consisting of implicitly black color values
for the RGB channels, but whose alpha channel is the
same as SourceGraphic. If this
option is used, then some implementations might need to
rasterize the graphics
elements in order to extract the alpha
channel.BackgroundImageThis keyword represents an image snapshot of the
canvas under the filter region at the time that the ‘filter’ element was
invoked. See Accessing the
background image.BackgroundAlphaSame as BackgroundImage except only
the alpha channel is used. See SourceAlpha and Accessing the
background image.FillPaintThis keyword represents the value of the ‘fill’ property on the
target element for the filter effect. The FillPaint
image has conceptually infinite extent. Frequently this
image is opaque everywhere, but it might not be if the
"paint" itself has alpha, as in the case of a gradient
or pattern which itself includes transparent or
semi-transparent parts.StrokePaintThis keyword represents the value of the ‘stroke’ property on the
target element for the filter effect. The StrokePaint
image has conceptually infinite extent. Frequently this
image is opaque everywhere, but it might not be if the
"paint" itself has alpha, as in the case of a gradient
or pattern which itself includes transparent or
semi-transparent parts.
The ‘in’ attribute is available on all filter
primitive elements that require an input.
Animatable:
yes.

15.7.3 Filter primitive subregion
All filter primitives have attributes ‘x’,
‘y’, ‘width’ and
‘height’ which identify a subregion which
restricts calculation and rendering of the given filter
primitive. These attributes are defined according to the same
rules as other filter primitives' coordinate and length
attributes and thus represent values in the coordinate system
established by attribute ‘primitiveUnits’ on the ‘filter’ element.
‘x’, ‘y’, ‘width’ and ‘height’ default to
the union (i.e., tightest fitting bounding box) of the
subregions defined for all referenced nodes. If there are no
referenced nodes (e.g., for ‘feImage’ or ‘feTurbulence’), or one or more
of the referenced nodes is a standard input (one of SourceGraphic, SourceAlpha, BackgroundImage, BackgroundAlpha, FillPaint or StrokePaint), or for ‘feTile’ (which is special
because its principal function is to replicate the referenced
node in X and Y and thereby produce a usually larger result),
the default subregion is 0%,0%,100%,100%, 
where as a special-case the percentages are relative to the dimensions of the filter region, thus making the 
the default filter primitive subregion equal to the filter region.
‘x’, ‘y’,
‘width’ and ‘height’ act as a
hard clip clipping rectangle on both the filter primitive's input image(s) and the filter primitive result.
All intermediate offscreens are defined to not exceed the
intersection of ‘x’, ‘y’,
‘width’ and ‘height’ with the filter region. The
filter region and any of the ‘x’,
‘y’, ‘width’ and
‘height’ subregions are to be set up such that
all offscreens are made big enough to accommodate any pixels
which even partly intersect with either the filter region or
the x,y,width,height subregions.
‘feTile’ references a previous
filter primitive and then stitches the tiles together based on
the ‘x’, ‘y’,
‘width’ and ‘height’ values of
the referenced filter primitive in order to fill its own 
filter primitive subregion.
Example primitive-subregion-01 demonstrates the effect
of specifying a filter primitive subregion:
&lt;svg width="400" height="400" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt; 
&lt;defs&gt;
&lt;filter id="flood" x="0" y="0" width="100%" height="100%" primitiveUnits="objectBoundingBox"&gt;
&lt;feFlood x="25%" y="25%" width="50%" height="50%"

&lt;feMerge x="25%" y="25%" width="50%" height="50%"&gt;
&lt;feMergeNode in="SourceGraphic"/&gt;
&lt;feMergeNode in="FillPaint"/&gt;
&lt;/feMerge&gt;
&lt;/filter&gt;
&lt;/defs&gt;

&lt;/g&gt;

&lt;g transform="translate(0 200)"&gt;
&lt;g fill="none" stroke="blue" stroke-width="4"&gt;

&lt;/g&gt;
&lt;/svg&gt;Example primitive-subregion-01View this example as SVG (SVG-enabled browsers only)

In the example above there are three rects that each have a cross and a circle in them. 
The circle element in each one has a different filter applied, but with the same filter primitive subregion. 
The filter output should be limited to the filter primitive subregion, so you should never see the circles themselves, 
just the rects that make up the filter primitive subregion. 

The upper left rect shows an ‘feFlood’ with flood-opacity="75%" so the cross should be visible through the green rect in the middle.

The lower left rect shows an ‘feMerge’ that merges SourceGraphic with FillPaint. Since the circle has fill-opacity="0.5" it will also be transparent so that the cross is visible through the green rect in the middle.

The upper right rect shows an ‘feBlend’ that has mode="multiply". Since the circle in this case isn't transparent the result is totally opaque. The rect should be dark green and the cross should not be visible through it.

15.8 Light source elements and properties
15.8.1 Introduction

specified.
Animatable:
yes.pointsAtZ = "&lt;number&gt;"Z location in the coordinate system established by
attribute ‘primitiveUnits’ on the ‘filter’ element of the
point at which the light source is pointing, assuming that, in the initial
coordinate system, the positive Z-axis comes out

If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 1 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.limitingConeAngle = "&lt;number&gt;"A limiting cone which restricts the region where the
light is projected. No light is projected outside the cone.
‘limitingConeAngle’ represents
the angle in degrees between the spot light axis (i.e. the axis
between the light source and the point to which it is
pointing at) and the spot light cone. User agents should
apply a smoothing technique such as anti-aliasing at the
boundary of the cone.
If no value is specified, then no limiting cone will be
applied.

15.9 Filter primitive ‘feBlend’
This filter composites two objects together using commonly
used imaging software blending modes. It performs a pixel-wise
combination of two input images.
‘feBlend’Categories:Filter primitive elementContent model:Any number of the following elements, in any order:
‘animate’‘set’Attributes:core attributes  — , , , presentation attributes  — , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , filter primitive attributes  — , , , , ‘class’‘style’‘in’‘in2’‘mode’DOM Interfaces:SVGFEBlendElement

Attribute definitions:
mode = "normal | multiply | screen
| darken | lighten"One of the image blending modes (see table below). If attribute ‘mode’ is not specified, then the effect is as if a value of normal were specified.
Animatable:
yes.in2 = "(see ‘in’ attribute)"The second input image to the blending operation. This
attribute can take on the same values as the ‘in’ attribute.
Animatable:
yes.

For all feBlend modes, the result opacity is computed as
follows:
qr = 1 - (1-qa)*(1-qb)

For the compositing formulas below, the following
definitions apply:
cr = Result color (RGB) - premultiplied 
qa = Opacity value at a given pixel for image A 
qb = Opacity value at a given pixel for image B 
ca = Color (RGB) at a given pixel for image A - premultiplied 
cb = Color (RGB) at a given pixel for image B - premultiplied 

The following
table provides the list of available image blending modes:
Image Blending ModeFormula for computing result colornormalcr = (1 - qa) * cb + camultiplycr = (1-qa)*cb + (1-qb)*ca + ca*cbscreencr = cb + ca - ca * cbdarkencr = Min ((1 - qa) * cb + ca, (1 - qb) * ca
+ cb)lightencr = Max ((1 - qa) * cb + ca, (1 - qb) * ca
+ cb)
'normal' blend mode is
equivalent to operator="over" on the ‘feComposite’ filter primitive,
matches the blending method used by ‘feMerge’ and matches the simple alpha
compositing technique used in SVG for all compositing
outside of filter effects.
Example feBlend shows
examples of the five blend modes.

on the RGBA color and alpha values of every pixel on the
input graphics to produce a result with a new set of RGBA color
and alpha values.
The calculations are performed on non-premultiplied color
values. If the input graphics consists of premultiplied color
values, those values are automatically converted into
non-premultiplied color values for this operation.
These matrices often perform an identity mapping in the
alpha channel. If that is the case, an implementation can avoid
the costly undoing and redoing of the premultiplication for all
pixels with A = 1.

Attribute definitions:
type = "matrix | saturate |
hueRotate | luminanceToAlpha"Indicates the type of matrix operation. The keyword
'matrix' indicates that a full
5x4 matrix of values will be provided. The other keywords
represent convenience shortcuts to allow commonly used
color operations to be performed without specifying a
complete matrix. If attribute ‘type’ is not specified, then the effect is as if a value of matrix were specified.
Animatable:
yes.values = "list of &lt;number&gt;s"
The contents of ‘values’
depends on the value of attribute ‘type’: 

For type="matrix",
‘values’ is a list of 20
matrix values (a00 a01 a02 a03 a04 a10 a11 ... a34),
separated by whitespace and/or a comma. For example,
the identity matrix could be expressed as: 
type="matrix" 
values="1 0 0 0 0  0 1 0 0 0  0 0 1 0 0  0 0 0 1 0"

For type="saturate",
‘values’ is a single
real number value (0 to 1). A saturate operation is
equivalent to the following matrix operation: 
| R' |     |0.213+0.787s  0.715-0.715s  0.072-0.072s 0  0 |   | R |
| G' |     |0.213-0.213s  0.715+0.285s  0.072-0.072s 0  0 |   | G |
| B' |  =  |0.213-0.213s  0.715-0.715s  0.072+0.928s 0  0 | * | B |
| A' |     |           0            0             0  1  0 |   | A |
| 1  |     |           0            0             0  0  1 |   | 1 |

For type="hueRotate",
‘values’ is a single one
real number value (degrees). A hueRotate operation is
equivalent to the following matrix operation: 
| R' |     | a00  a01  a02  0  0 |   | R |
| G' |     | a10  a11  a12  0  0 |   | G |
| B' |  =  | a20  a21  a22  0  0 | * | B |
| A' |     | 0    0    0    1  0 |   | A |
| 1  |     | 0    0    0    0  1 |   | 1 |

where the terms a00, a01, etc. are calculated as
follows: 
| a00 a01 a02 |    [+0.213 +0.715 +0.072]
| a10 a11 a12 | =  [+0.213 +0.715 +0.072] +
| a20 a21 a22 |    [+0.213 +0.715 +0.072]
[+0.787 -0.715 -0.072]
cos(hueRotate value) *  [-0.213 +0.285 -0.072] +
[-0.213 -0.715 +0.928]
[-0.213 -0.715+0.928]
sin(hueRotate value) *  [+0.143 +0.140-0.283]
[-0.787 +0.715+0.072]

Thus, the upper left term of the hue matrix turns out
to be: 
.213 + cos(hueRotate value)*.787 - sin(hueRotate value)*.213

For type="luminanceToAlpha",
‘values’ is not
applicable. A luminanceToAlpha operation
is equivalent to the following matrix operation: 
| R' |     |      0        0        0  0  0 |   | R |
| G' |     |      0        0        0  0  0 |   | G |
| B' |  =  |      0        0        0  0  0 | * | B |
| A' |     | 0.2125   0.7154   0.0721  0  0 |   | A |
| 1  |     |      0        0        0  0  1 |   | 1 |

If the attribute is not specified, then the default
behavior depends on the value of attribute ‘type’. If type="matrix", then this
attribute defaults to the identity matrix. If type="saturate", then this
attribute defaults to the value 1, which results in the
identity matrix. If type="hueRotate", then this
attribute defaults to the value 0, which results in the
identity matrix.
Animatable:
yes.

15.11 Filter primitive ‘feComponentTransfer’
This filter primitive performs component-wise remapping of
data as follows:
R' = feFuncR( R )
G' = feFuncG( G )
B' = feFuncB( B )
A' = feFuncA( A )

for every pixel. It allows operations like brightness
adjustment, contrast adjustment, color balance or
thresholding.
The calculations are performed on non-premultiplied color
values. If the input graphics consists of premultiplied color
values, those values are automatically converted into
non-premultiplied color values for this operation. (Note that
the undoing and redoing of the premultiplication can be avoided
if feFuncA is the
identity transform and all alpha values on the source graphic
are set to 1.)

The child elements of a ‘feComponentTransfer’ element specify the
transfer functions for the four channels:
‘feFuncR’ — transfer function for the red component of the input graphic‘feFuncG’ — transfer function for the green component of the input graphic‘feFuncB’ — transfer function for the blue component of the input graphic‘feFuncA’ — transfer function for the alpha component of the input graphic
The following rules apply to the processing of the ‘feComponentTransfer’ element:
If more than one transfer function element of the same kind is specified, the last occurrence is to be used.If any of the transfer function elements are unspecified, the ‘feComponentTransfer’ must be processed as if those transfer function elements were specified with their ‘type’ attributes set to 'identity'.

The attributes below are the
transfer function element attributes,
which apply to sub-elements ‘feFuncR’, ‘feFuncG’, ‘feFuncB’
and ‘feFuncA’ that define the transfer functions.

Attribute definitions:
type = "identity | table | discrete
| linear | gamma"
Indicates the type of component transfer function. The
type of function determines the applicability of the
other attributes.
In the following, C is the initial component (e.g.,
‘feFuncR’), C' is the remapped component; both
in the closed interval [0,1].

For identity: 
C' = C

For table, the
function is defined by linear interpolation
between values given in the attribute
‘tableValues’. The table has n+1
values (i.e., v0 to vn)
specifying the start and end values for n
evenly sized interpolation regions. Interpolations
use the following formula:
For a value C &lt; 1 find k
such that:
k/n &lt;= C &lt; (k+1)/n
The result C' is given by:
C' = vk + (C -
k/n)*n * (vk+1 - vk)
If C = 1 then:
C' = vn.

For discrete, the
function is defined by the step function given in the
attribute ‘tableValues’, which
provides a list of n values (i.e.,
v0 to vn-1) in order to
identify a step function consisting of n
steps. The step function is defined by the following
formula:
For a value C &lt; 1 find k
such that:
k/n &lt;= C &lt; (k+1)/n
The result C' is given by:
C' = vk
If C = 1 then:
C' = vn-1.

For linear, the
function is defined by the following linear equation:

C' = 
slope * C + 
intercept

For gamma, the
function is defined by the following exponential
function: 
C' = 
amplitude * pow(C,

exponent) + 
offset

Animatable:
yes.
tableValues = "(list of &lt;number&gt;s)"When type="table", the
list of &lt;number&gt;s
v0,v1,...vn, separated by white space and/or a
comma, which define the lookup table. An empty list results
in an identity transfer function.
If the attribute is not
specified, then the effect is as if an empty list were
provided.
Animatable:
yes.slope = "&lt;number&gt;"When type="linear", the
slope of the linear function.
If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 1 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.intercept = "&lt;number&gt;"When type="linear", the
intercept of the linear function.
If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 0 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.amplitude = "&lt;number&gt;"When type="gamma", the
amplitude of the gamma function.
If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 1 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.exponent = "&lt;number&gt;"When type="gamma", the
exponent of the gamma function.
If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 1 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.offset = "&lt;number&gt;"When type="gamma", the
offset of the gamma function.
If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 0 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.

15.12 Filter primitive ‘feComposite’
This filter performs the combination of the two input images
pixel-wise in image space using one of the Porter-Duff [PORTERDUFF] compositing
operations: over, in, atop, out, xor [SVG-COMPOSITING]. Additionally, a
component-wise arithmetic operation (with the result
clamped between [0..1]) can be applied.
The arithmetic operation is useful for combining
the output from the ‘feDiffuseLighting’ and ‘feSpecularLighting’ filters
with texture data. It is also useful for implementing
dissolve. If the arithmetic operation is
chosen, each result pixel is computed using the following
formula:
result = k1*i1*i2 + k2*i1 + k3*i2 + k4

where:

i1 and i2 indicate the corresponding pixel channel values of the input image, which map to in and in2 respectively

k1, k2, k3 and k4 indicate the values of the attributes with the same name

For this filter primitive, the extent of the resulting image
might grow as described in the section that describes the filter primitive
subregion.

of the ‘operator’ types except
arithmetic match the
corresponding operation as described in [PORTERDUFF]. The arithmetic operator is described

Example feComposite shows
examples of the six types of feComposite operations. It also
shows two different techniques to using the BackgroundImage as part of the
compositing operation.
The first two rows render bluish triangles into the
background. A filter is applied which composites reddish
triangles into the bluish triangles using one of the
compositing operations. The result from compositing is drawn
onto an opaque white temporary surface, and then that result is
written to the canvas. (The opaque white temporary surface
obliterates the original bluish triangle.)
The last two rows apply the same compositing operations of
reddish triangles into bluish triangles. However, the
compositing result is directly blended into the canvas (the
opaque white temporary surface technique is not used). In some
cases, the results are different than when a temporary opaque
white surface is used. The original bluish triangle from the
background shines through wherever the compositing operation
results in completely transparent pixel. In other cases, the
result from compositing is blended into the bluish triangle,
resulting in a different final color value.

15.13 Filter primitive ‘feConvolveMatrix’
feConvolveMatrix applies a matrix convolution filter effect.
A convolution combines pixels in the input image with
neighboring pixels to produce a resulting image. A wide variety
of imaging operations can be achieved through convolutions,
including blurring, edge detection, sharpening, embossing and
beveling.
A matrix convolution is based on an n-by-m matrix (the
convolution kernel) which describes how a given pixel value in
the input image is combined with its neighboring pixel values
to produce a resulting pixel value. Each result pixel is
determined by applying the kernel matrix to the corresponding
source pixel and its neighboring pixels. The basic convolution
formula which is applied to each color value for a given pixel
is:

COLORX,Y = ( 
              SUM
I=0 to [orderY-1] { 
                SUM
J=0 to [orderX-1] { 
                  SOURCE
X-targetX+J, Y-targetY+I * 

kernelMatrixorderX-J-1, 
orderY-I-1 
                } 
              } 
            ) / 
divisor + 
bias * ALPHAX,Y

where "orderX" and "orderY" represent the X and Y values for
the ‘order’ attribute, "targetX"
represents the value of the ‘targetX’ attribute, "targetY"
represents the value of the ‘targetY’ attribute, "kernelMatrix"
represents the value of the ‘kernelMatrix’ attribute,
"divisor" represents the value of the ‘divisor’ attribute, and "bias"
represents the value of the ‘bias’ attribute.
Note in the above formulas that the values in the kernel
matrix are applied such that the kernel matrix is rotated 180
degrees relative to the source and destination images in order
to match convolution theory as described in many computer
graphics textbooks.
To illustrate, suppose you have a input image which is 5
pixels by 5 pixels, whose color values for one of the color
channels are as follows:
0  20  40 235 235
100 120 140 235 235
200 220 240 235 235
225 225 255 255 255
225 225 255 255 255

and you define a 3-by-3 convolution kernel as follows:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

Let's focus on the color value at the second row and second
column of the image (source pixel value is 120). Assuming the
simplest case (where the input image's pixel grid aligns
perfectly with the kernel's pixel grid) and assuming default
values for attributes ‘divisor’,
‘targetX’ and ‘targetY’, then resulting color value
will be:
(9*  0 + 8* 20 + 7* 40 +
6*100 + 5*120 + 4*140 +
3*200 + 2*220 + 1*240) / (9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1)

Because they operate on pixels, matrix convolutions are
inherently resolution-dependent. To make ‘feConvolveMatrix’ produce
resolution-independent results, an explicit value should be
provided for either the ‘filterRes’ attribute on the ‘filter’ element and/or
attribute ‘kernelUnitLength’.
‘kernelUnitLength’, in
combination with the other attributes, defines an implicit
pixel grid in the filter effects coordinate system (i.e., the
coordinate system established by the ‘primitiveUnits’ attribute). If the
pixel grid established by ‘kernelUnitLength’ is not
scaled to match the pixel grid established by attribute ‘filterRes’ (implicitly or
explicitly), then the input image will be temporarily rescaled
to match its pixels with ‘kernelUnitLength’. The
convolution happens on the resampled image. After applying the
convolution, the image is resampled back to the original
resolution.
When the image must be resampled to match the coordinate
system defined by ‘kernelUnitLength’ prior to
convolution, or resampled to match the device coordinate system
after convolution, it is recommended that high
quality viewers make use of appropriate interpolation
techniques, for example bilinear or bicubic. Depending on the
speed of the available interpolents, this choice may be
affected by the ‘image-rendering’ property
setting. Note that implementations might choose approaches that
minimize or eliminate resampling when not necessary to produce
proper results, such as when the document is zoomed out such
that ‘kernelUnitLength’ is
considerably smaller than a device pixel.

Attribute definitions:
order = "&lt;number-optional-number&gt;"Indicates the number of cells in each dimension for
‘kernelMatrix’. The values
provided must be &lt;integer&gt;s
greater than zero. The first number, &lt;orderX&gt;,
indicates the number of columns in the matrix. The second
number, &lt;orderY&gt;, indicates the number of rows in the
matrix. If &lt;orderY&gt; is not provided, it defaults to
&lt;orderX&gt;.
A typical value is order="3". It is recommended that only
small values (e.g., 3) be used; higher values may result in
very high CPU overhead and usually do not produce results
that justify the impact on performance.
If the attribute is not specified, the effect is as if a
value of 3 were specified.
Animatable:
yes.
kernelMatrix = "&lt;list of numbers&gt;"The list of &lt;number&gt;s that
make up the kernel matrix for the convolution. Values are
separated by space characters and/or a comma. The number of
entries in the list must equal &lt;orderX&gt; times
&lt;orderY&gt;.
Animatable:
yes.divisor = "&lt;number&gt;"After applying the ‘kernelMatrix’ to the input image to
yield a number, that number is divided by ‘divisor’ to yield the final
destination color value. A divisor that is the sum of all
the matrix values tends to have an evening effect on the
overall color intensity of the result. It is an error to
specify a divisor of zero. The default value is the sum of
all values in kernelMatrix, with the exception that if the
sum is zero, then the divisor is set to 1.
Animatable:
yes.bias = "&lt;number&gt;"After applying the ‘kernelMatrix’ to the input image to
yield a number and applying the ‘divisor’, the ‘bias’ attribute is added to each
component. One application of ‘bias’ is when it is desirable to
have .5 gray value be the zero response of the filter. The bias property shifts
the range of the filter. This allows representation of values that would
otherwise be clamped to 0 or 1. If ‘bias’ is not specified, then
the effect is as if a value of 0 were specified.
Animatable:
yes.targetX = "&lt;integer&gt;"Determines the positioning in X of the convolution
matrix relative to a given target pixel in the input image.
The leftmost column of the matrix is column number zero.
The value must be such that: 0 &lt;= targetX &lt; orderX.
By default, the convolution matrix is centered in X over
each pixel of the input image (i.e., targetX = floor (
orderX / 2 )).
Animatable:
yes.targetY = "&lt;integer&gt;"Determines the positioning in Y of the convolution
matrix relative to a given target pixel in the input image.
The topmost row of the matrix is row number zero. The value
must be such that: 0 &lt;= targetY &lt; orderY. By default,
the convolution matrix is centered in Y over each pixel of
the input image (i.e., targetY = floor ( orderY / 2
)).
Animatable:
yes.edgeMode = "duplicate | wrap | none"
Determines how to extend the input image as necessary
with color values so that the matrix operations can be
applied when the kernel is positioned at or near the edge
of the input image.
"duplicate" indicates that the input image is extended
along each of its borders as necessary by duplicating the
color values at the given edge of the input image.

"wrap" indicates that the input image is extended by
taking the color values from the opposite edge of the
image.

"none" indicates that the input image is extended with
pixel values of zero for R, G, B and A.

If attribute ‘edgeMode’ is not specified, then the effect is as if a value of duplicate were specified.

Animatable:
yes.

kernelUnitLength = "&lt;number-optional-number&gt;"The first number is the &lt;dx&gt; value. The second
number is the &lt;dy&gt; value. If the &lt;dy&gt; value is
not specified, it defaults to the same value as &lt;dx&gt;.
Indicates the intended distance in current filter units
(i.e., units as determined by the value of attribute ‘primitiveUnits’) between
successive columns and rows, respectively, in the ‘kernelMatrix’. By specifying
value(s) for ‘kernelUnitLength’, the kernel
becomes defined in a scalable, abstract coordinate system.
If ‘kernelUnitLength’ is not
specified, the default value is one pixel in the offscreen
bitmap, which is a pixel-based coordinate system, and thus
potentially not scalable. For some level of consistency
across display media and user agents, it is necessary that
a value be provided for at least one of ‘filterRes’ and ‘kernelUnitLength’. In some
implementations, the most consistent results and the
fastest performance will be achieved if the pixel grid of
the temporary offscreen images aligns with the pixel grid
of the kernel.
A negative or zero value is an error (see Error
processing).
Animatable:
yes.
preserveAlpha = "false | true"A value of false
indicates that the convolution will apply to all channels,
including the alpha channel. In this case the ALPHAX,Y
of the convolution formula for a given pixel is:

ALPHAX,Y = ( 
              SUM
I=0 to [orderY-1] { 
                SUM
J=0 to [orderX-1] { 
                  SOURCE
X-targetX+J, Y-targetY+I * 

kernelMatrixorderX-J-1, 
orderY-I-1 
                } 
              } 
            ) / 
divisor + 
bias 

A value of true indicates
that the convolution will only apply to the color channels.
In this case, the filter will temporarily unpremultiply the
color component values, apply the kernel, and then
re-premultiply at the end. In this case the ALPHAX,Y
of the convolution formula for a given pixel is:

ALPHAX,Y = SOURCEX,Y

If ‘preserveAlpha’ is not
specified, then the effect is as if a value of false were specified.
Animatable:
yes.

15.14 Filter primitive ‘feDiffuseLighting’
This filter primitive lights an image using the alpha
channel as a bump map. The resulting image is an RGBA opaque
image based on the light color with alpha = 1.0 everywhere. The
lighting calculation follows the standard diffuse component of
the Phong lighting model. The resulting image depends on the
light color, light position and surface geometry of the input
bump map.
The light map produced by this filter primitive can be
combined with a texture image using the multiply term of the
arithmetic ‘feComposite’ compositing
method. Multiple light sources can be simulated by adding
several of these light maps together before applying it to the
texture image.
The formulas below make use of 3x3 filters. Because they
operate on pixels, such filters are inherently
resolution-dependent. To make ‘feDiffuseLighting’ produce
resolution-independent results, an explicit value should be
provided for either the ‘filterRes’ attribute on the ‘filter’ element and/or
attribute ‘kernelUnitLength’.
‘kernelUnitLength’, in combination
with the other attributes, defines an implicit pixel grid in
the filter effects coordinate system (i.e., the coordinate
system established by the ‘primitiveUnits’ attribute). If the
pixel grid established by ‘kernelUnitLength’ is not scaled to
match the pixel grid established by attribute ‘filterRes’ (implicitly or
explicitly), then the input image will be temporarily rescaled
to match its pixels with ‘kernelUnitLength’. The 3x3 filters
are applied to the resampled image. After applying the filter,
the image is resampled back to its original resolution.
When the image must be resampled, it is recommended that high
quality viewers make use of appropriate interpolation
techniques, for example bilinear or bicubic. Depending on the
speed of the available interpolents, this choice may be
affected by the ‘image-rendering’ property
setting. Note that implementations might choose approaches that
minimize or eliminate resampling when not necessary to produce
proper results, such as when the document is zoomed out such
that ‘kernelUnitLength’ is
considerably smaller than a device pixel.
For the formulas that follow, the
Norm(Ax,Ay,Az)
function is defined as:

Norm(Ax,Ay,Az) =
sqrt(Ax^2+Ay^2+Az^2)
The resulting RGBA image is computed as follows:
Dr = kd * N.L *
Lr
Dg = kd * N.L * Lg
Db = kd * N.L * Lb
Da = 1.0
where
kd = diffuse lighting constant
N = surface normal unit vector, a function of x and y
L = unit vector pointing from surface to light, a function
of x and y in the point and spot light cases
Lr,Lg,Lb = RGB components
of light, a function of x and y in the spot light case
N is a function of x and y and depends on the surface
gradient as follows:
The surface described by the input alpha image
I(x,y) is:
Z (x,y) = surfaceScale *
I(x,y)
Surface normal is calculated using the Sobel gradient 3x3
filter. Different filter kernels are used depending on whether
the given pixel is on the interior or an edge. For each case,
the formula is:
Nx (x,y)= - surfaceScale *
FACTORx *
           (Kx(0,0)*I(x-dx,y-dy) +
Kx(1,0)*I(x,y-dy) +
Kx(2,0)*I(x+dx,y-dy) +
            Kx(0,1)*I(x-dx,y)    +
Kx(1,1)*I(x,y)    +
Kx(2,1)*I(x+dx,y)    +
            Kx(0,2)*I(x-dx,y+dy) +
Kx(1,2)*I(x,y+dy) +
Kx(2,2)*I(x+dx,y+dy))
Ny (x,y)= - surfaceScale * FACTORy
*
           (Ky(0,0)*I(x-dx,y-dy) +
Ky(1,0)*I(x,y-dy) +
Ky(2,0)*I(x+dx,y-dy) +
            Ky(0,1)*I(x-dx,y)    +
Ky(1,1)*I(x,y)    +
Ky(2,1)*I(x+dx,y)    +
            Ky(0,2)*I(x-dx,y+dy) +
Ky(1,2)*I(x,y+dy) +
Ky(2,2)*I(x+dx,y+dy))
Nz (x,y) = 1.0

N = (Nx, Ny, Nz) /
Norm((Nx,Ny,Nz))
In these formulas, the dx and dy
values (e.g., I(x-dx,y-dy)), represent deltas
relative to a given (x,y) position for the purpose
of estimating the slope of the surface at that point. These
deltas are determined by the value (explicit or implicit) of
attribute ‘kernelUnitLength’.

L, the unit vector from the image sample to the light, is
calculated as follows:
For Infinite light sources it is constant:
Lx =
cos(azimuth)*cos(elevation)
Ly = sin(azimuth)*cos(elevation)
Lz = sin(elevation)
For Point and spot lights it is a function of position:
Lx = Lightx -
x
Ly = Lighty - y
Lz = Lightz - Z(x,y)

L = (Lx, Ly, Lz) /
Norm(Lx, Ly, Lz)
where Lightx, Lighty, and
Lightz are the input light position.
Lr,Lg,Lb, the light color
vector, is a function of position in the spot light case
only:
Lr =
Lightr*pow((-L.S),specularExponent)
Lg =
Lightg*pow((-L.S),specularExponent)
Lb =
Lightb*pow((-L.S),specularExponent)
where S is the unit vector pointing from the light to the
point (pointsAtX, pointsAtY, pointsAtZ) in the x-y plane:
Sx = pointsAtX -
Lightx
Sy = pointsAtY - Lighty
Sz = pointsAtZ - Lightz

S = (Sx, Sy, Sz) /
Norm(Sx, Sy, Sz)
If L.S is positive, no light is present. (Lr =
Lg = Lb = 0). If ‘limitingConeAngle’ is specified, -L.S &lt; cos(limitingConeAngle) also indicates that no light is present.

‘kernelUnitLength’, the kernel
becomes defined in a scalable, abstract coordinate system.
If ‘kernelUnitLength’ is not
specified, the dx and dy values
should represent very small deltas relative to a given
(x,y) position, which might be implemented in
some cases as one pixel in the intermediate image offscreen
bitmap, which is a pixel-based coordinate system, and thus
potentially not scalable. For some level of consistency
across display media and user agents, it is necessary that
a value be provided for at least one of ‘filterRes’ and ‘kernelUnitLength’. Discussion of
intermediate images are in the Introduction and in
the description of attribute ‘filterRes’.
A negative or zero value is an error (see Error
processing).
Animatable:
yes.

The light source is defined by one of the child elements ‘feDistantLight’, ‘fePointLight’ or ‘feSpotLight’. The light color
is specified by property ‘lighting-color’.
15.15 Filter primitive ‘feDisplacementMap’
This filter primitive uses the pixels values from the image
from ‘in2’ to spatially displace the
image from ‘in’. This is the transformation to
be performed:
P'(x,y) &lt;- P( x + scale * (XC(x,y) - .5), y + scale * (YC(x,y) - .5))

where P(x,y) is the input image, ‘in’, and P'(x,y) is the
destination. XC(x,y) and YC(x,y) are the component values of
the channel designated by the xChannelSelector and
yChannelSelector. For example, to use the R component
of ‘in2’ to control displacement in x
and the G component of Image2 to control displacement in y, set
xChannelSelector to "R" and yChannelSelector
to "G".
The displacement map defines the inverse of the mapping
performed.
The input image in is to remain premultiplied for this filter primitive. The calculations using the pixel values from ‘in2’ are performed using non-premultiplied color values. If the image from ‘in2’ consists of premultiplied color values, those values are automatically converted into non-premultiplied color values before performing this operation.
This filter can have arbitrary non-localized effect on the
input which might require substantial buffering in the
processing pipeline. However with this formulation, any
intermediate buffering needs can be determined by
scale which represents the maximum range of
displacement in either x or y.
When applying this filter, the source pixel location will
often lie between several source pixels. In this case it is
recommended that high
quality viewers apply an interpolent on the surrounding
pixels, for example bilinear or bicubic, rather than simply
selecting the nearest source pixel. Depending on the speed of
the available interpolents, this choice may be affected by the
‘image-rendering’ property
setting.
The ‘color-interpolation-filters’
property only applies to the ‘in2’ source image and does not
apply to the ‘in’ source image. The ‘in’ source image must remain in its current color space.

15.16 Filter primitive ‘feFlood’
This filter primitive creates a rectangle filled with the
color and opacity values from properties ‘flood-color’ and ‘flood-opacity’. The rectangle is as
large as the filter primitive
subregion established by the ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘width’ and ‘height’ attributes on the ‘feFlood’ element.

15.17 Filter primitive ‘feGaussianBlur’
This filter primitive performs a Gaussian blur on the input
image.
The Gaussian blur kernel is an approximation of the
normalized convolution:
G(x,y) = H(x)I(y)
where
H(x) = exp(-x2/ (2s2)) / sqrt(2* pi*s2)
and 
I(y) = exp(-y2/ (2t2)) / sqrt(2* pi*t2)
with 's' being the standard deviation in the x direction
and 't' being the standard deviation in the y direction, as specified by ‘stdDeviation’.
The value of ‘stdDeviation’ can be either one or
two numbers. If two numbers are provided, the first number
represents a standard deviation value along the x-axis of the
current coordinate system and the second value represents a
standard deviation in Y. If one number is provided, then that
value is used for both X and Y.
Even if only one value is provided for ‘stdDeviation’, this can be
implemented as a separable convolution.
For larger values of 's' (s &gt;= 2.0), an approximation can
be used: Three successive box-blurs build a piece-wise
quadratic convolution kernel, which approximates the Gaussian
kernel to within roughly 3%.
let d = floor(s * 3*sqrt(2*pi)/4 +
0.5)
... if d is odd, use three box-blurs of size 'd', centered
on the output pixel.
... if d is even, two box-blurs of size 'd' (the first one
centered on the pixel boundary between the output pixel and the
one to the left, the second one centered on the pixel boundary
between the output pixel and the one to the right) and one box
blur of size 'd+1' centered on the output pixel.
Note: the approximation formula also applies correspondingly to 't'.
Frequently this operation will take place on alpha-only
images, such as that produced by the built-in input, SourceAlpha. The implementation
may notice this and optimize the single channel case. If the
input has infinite extent and is constant (e.g FillPaint 
where the fill is a solid color), this operation has
no effect. If the input has infinite extent and the filter result is the input to an ‘feTile’, the
filter is evaluated with periodic boundary conditions.

Attribute definitions:
stdDeviation = "&lt;number-optional-number&gt;"The standard deviation for the blur operation. If two
&lt;number&gt;s are
provided, the first number represents a standard deviation
value along the x-axis of the coordinate system established
by attribute ‘primitiveUnits’ on the ‘filter’ element. The
second value represents a standard deviation in Y. If one
number is provided, then that value is used for both X and
Y.
A negative value is an error (see Error processing).
A value of zero disables the effect of the given filter primitive (i.e., the result is the filter input image). If ‘stdDeviation’ is 0 in only one of X or Y, 
then the effect is that the blur is only applied in the direction that has a non-zero value.

If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 0 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.

The example at the
start of this chapter makes use of the ‘feGaussianBlur’ filter primitive to
create a drop shadow effect.
15.18 Filter primitive ‘feImage’
This filter primitive refers to a graphic external to this
filter element, which is loaded or rendered into an RGBA raster
and becomes the result of the filter primitive.
This filter primitive can refer to an external image or can
be a reference to another piece of SVG. It produces an image
similar to the built-in image source SourceGraphic except that the
graphic comes from an external source.
If the ‘xlink:href’ references
a stand-alone image resource such as a JPEG, PNG or SVG file,
then the image resource is rendered according to the behavior
of the ‘image’ element; otherwise, the
referenced resource is rendered according to the behavior of
the ‘use’ element. In either case,
the current user coordinate system depends on the value of
attribute ‘primitiveUnits’ on the ‘filter’ element. The
processing of the ‘preserveAspectRatio’ attribute on
the ‘feImage’ element is
identical to that of the ‘image’ element.
When the referenced image must be resampled to match the
device coordinate system, it is recommended that high
quality viewers make use of appropriate interpolation
techniques, for example bilinear or bicubic. Depending on the
speed of the available interpolents, this choice may be
affected by the ‘image-rendering’ property
setting.

to an object. From left to right:

The default placement of an image. Note that the image is
centered in the filter region and has the maximum size that will
fit in the region consistent with preserving the aspect ratio.

The image stretched to fit the bounding box of an object.

The image placed using user coordinates. Note that the image is
first centered in a box the size of the filter region and has the
maximum size that will fit in the box consistent with preserving
the aspect ratio. This box is then shifted by the given 'x' and
'y' values relative to the viewport the object is in.

15.19 Filter primitive ‘feMerge’
This filter primitive composites input image layers on top
of each other using the over operator with
Input1 (corresponding to the first ‘feMergeNode’ child element) on
the bottom and the last specified input, InputN
(corresponding to the last ‘feMergeNode’ child element),
on top.
Many effects produce a number of intermediate layers in
order to create the final output image. This filter allows us
to collapse those into a single image. Although this could be
done by using n-1 Composite-filters, it is more convenient to
have this common operation available in this form, and offers
the implementation some additional flexibility.
Each ‘feMerge’ element can have any number of ‘feMergeNode’
subelements, each of which has an ‘in’ attribute.
The canonical implementation of feMerge is to render the
entire effect into one RGBA layer, and then render the
resulting layer on the output device. In certain cases (in
particular if the output device itself is a continuous tone
device), and since merging is associative, it might be a
sufficient approximation to evaluate the effect one layer at a
time and render each layer individually onto the output device
bottom to top.
If the topmost image input is SourceGraphic and this ‘feMerge’ is the last filter
primitive in the filter, the implementation is encouraged to
render the layers up to that point, and then render the SourceGraphic directly from its
vector description on top.

chapter makes use of the ‘feMerge’ filter primitive to composite
two intermediate filter results together.
15.20 Filter primitive ‘feMorphology’
This filter primitive performs "fattening" or "thinning" of
artwork. It is particularly useful for fattening or thinning an
alpha channel.
The dilation (or erosion) kernel is a rectangle with a width
of 2*x-radius and a height of 2*y-radius. In
dilation, the output pixel is the individual component-wise
maximum of the corresponding R,G,B,A values in the input
image's kernel rectangle. In erosion, the output pixel is the
individual component-wise minimum of the corresponding R,G,B,A
values in the input image's kernel rectangle.
Frequently this operation will take place on alpha-only
images, such as that produced by the built-in input, SourceAlpha. In that case, the
implementation might want to optimize the single channel
case.
If the input has infinite extent and is constant (e.g 
FillPaint 
where the fill is a solid color), this operation has
no effect. If the input has infinite extent and the filter result 
is the input to an ‘feTile’, the filter is evaluated with 
periodic boundary conditions.

Because ‘feMorphology’
operates on premultipied color values, it will always result in
color values less than or equal to the alpha channel.

second value represents a y-radius. If one number is
provided, then that value is used for both X and Y. The
values are in the coordinate system established by
attribute ‘primitiveUnits’ on the ‘filter’ element.
A negative value is an error (see Error processing).

15.21 Filter primitive ‘feOffset’
This filter primitive offsets the input image relative to
its current position in the image space by the specified
vector.
This is important for effects like drop shadows.
When applying this filter, the destination location may be
offset by a fraction of a pixel in device space. In this case a
high
quality viewer should make use of appropriate interpolation
techniques, for example bilinear or bicubic. This is especially
recommended for dynamic viewers where this interpolation
provides visually smoother movement of images. For static
viewers this is less of a concern. Close attention should be
made to the ‘image-rendering’ property setting
to determine the authors intent.

yes.dy = "&lt;number&gt;"The amount to offset the input graphic along the
y-axis. The offset amount is expressed in the coordinate
system established by attribute ‘primitiveUnits’ on the ‘filter’ element.

if a value of 0 were
specified.

The example at the
start of this chapter makes use of the ‘feOffset’ filter primitive to offset
the drop shadow from the original source graphic.
15.22 Filter primitive ‘feSpecularLighting’
This filter primitive lights a source graphic using the
alpha channel as a bump map. The resulting image is an RGBA
image based on the light color. The lighting calculation
follows the standard specular component of the Phong lighting
model. The resulting image depends on the light color, light
position and surface geometry of the input bump map. The result
of the lighting calculation is added. The filter primitive
assumes that the viewer is at infinity in the z direction
(i.e., the unit vector in the eye direction is (0,0,1)
everywhere).
This filter primitive produces an image which contains the
specular reflection part of the lighting calculation. Such a
map is intended to be combined with a texture using the
add term of the arithmetic ‘feComposite’ method. Multiple
light sources can be simulated by adding several of these light
maps before applying it to the texture image.
The resulting RGBA image is computed as follows:
Sr = ks *
pow(N.H, specularExponent) * Lr
Sg = ks * pow(N.H,
specularExponent) * Lg
Sb = ks * pow(N.H,
specularExponent) * Lb
Sa = max(Sr, Sg,
Sb)
where
ks = specular lighting constant
N = surface normal unit vector, a function of x and y
H = "halfway" unit vector between eye unit vector and light
unit vector

Lr,Lg,Lb = RGB components
of light
See ‘feDiffuseLighting’ for
definition of N and (Lr, Lg,
Lb).
The definition of H reflects our assumption of the constant
eye vector E = (0,0,1):
H = (L + E) / Norm(L+E)
where L is the light unit vector.
Unlike the ‘feDiffuseLighting’, the ‘feSpecularLighting’ filter
produces a non-opaque image. This is due to the fact that the
specular result
(Sr,Sg,Sb,Sa) is
meant to be added to the textured image. The alpha channel of
the result is the max of the color components, so that where
the specular light is zero, no additional coverage is added to
the image and a fully white highlight will add opacity.
The ‘feDiffuseLighting’ and ‘feSpecularLighting’ filters will
often be applied together. An implementation may detect this
and calculate both maps in one pass, instead of two.

Indicates the intended distance in current filter units
(i.e., units as determined by the value of attribute ‘primitiveUnits’) for
dx and dy, respectively, in the
surface
normal calculation formulas. By specifying value(s) for
‘kernelUnitLength’, the kernel
becomes defined in a scalable, abstract coordinate system.
If ‘kernelUnitLength’ is not
specified, the dx and dy values
should represent very small deltas relative to a given
(x,y) position, which might be implemented in
some cases as one pixel in the intermediate image offscreen
bitmap, which is a pixel-based coordinate system, and thus
potentially not scalable. For some level of consistency
across display media and user agents, it is necessary that
a value be provided for at least one of ‘filterRes’ and ‘kernelUnitLength’. Discussion of
intermediate images are in the Introduction and in
the description of attribute ‘filterRes’.
A negative or zero value is an error (see Error
processing).
Animatable:
yes.

The light source is defined by one of the child elements ‘feDistantLight’, ‘fePointLight’ or ‘feDistantLight’. The light
color is specified by property ‘lighting-color’.
The example at the
start of this chapter makes use of the ‘feSpecularLighting’ filter primitive
to achieve a highly reflective, 3D glowing effect.
15.23 Filter primitive ‘feTile’
This filter primitive fills a target rectangle with a
repeated, tiled pattern of an input image. The target rectangle
is as large as the filter primitive
subregion established by the ‘x’, ‘y’, ‘width’ and ‘height’ attributes on the ‘feTile’ element.
Typically, the input image has been defined with its own filter primitive
subregion in order to define a reference tile. ‘feTile’ replicates the reference
tile in both X and Y to completely fill the target rectangle.
The top/left corner of each given tile is at location
(x+i*width,y+j*height), where (x,y)
represents the top/left of the input image's filter primitive
subregion, width and height represent
the width and height of the input image's filter primitive
subregion, and i and j can be any
integer value. In most cases, the input image will have a
smaller filter primitive subregion than the ‘feTile’ in order to achieve a
repeated pattern effect.
Implementers must take appropriate measures in constructing
the tiled image to avoid artifacts between tiles, particularly
in situations where the user to device transform includes shear
and/or rotation. Unless care is taken, interpolation can lead
to edge pixels in the tile having opacity values lower or
higher than expected due to the interaction of painting
adjacent tiles which each have partial overlap with particular
pixels.

15.24 Filter primitive ‘feTurbulence’
This filter primitive creates an image using the Perlin
turbulence function. It allows the synthesis of artificial
textures like clouds or marble. For a detailed description the
of the Perlin turbulence function, see "Texturing and
Modeling", Ebert et al, AP Professional, 1994. The resulting
image will fill the entire filter primitive
subregion for this filter primitive.
It is possible to create bandwidth-limited noise by
synthesizing only one octave.
The C code below shows the exact algorithm used for this
filter effect.
For fractalSum, you get a turbFunctionResult that is aimed
at a range of -1 to 1 (the actual result might exceed this
range in some cases). To convert to a color value, use the
formula colorValue = ((turbFunctionResult * 255) + 255) /
2, then clamp to the range 0 to 255.
For turbulence, you get a turbFunctionResult that is aimed
at a range of 0 to 1 (the actual result might exceed this range
in some cases). To convert to a color value, use the formula
colorValue = (turbFunctionResult * 255), then
clamp to the range 0 to 255.
The following order is used for applying the pseudo random
numbers. An initial seed value is computed based on attribute
‘seed’. Then the implementation
computes the lattice points for R, then continues getting
additional pseudo random numbers relative to the last generated
pseudo random number and computes the lattice points for G, and
so on for B and A.
The generated color and alpha values are in the color space
determined by the value of property ‘color-interpolation-filters’:
/* Produces results in the range [1, 2**31 - 2].
Algorithm is: r = (a * r) mod m
where a = 16807 and m = 2**31 - 1 = 2147483647
See [Park & Miller], CACM vol. 31 no. 10 p. 1195, Oct. 1988
To test: the algorithm should produce the result 1043618065
as the 10,000th generated number if the original seed is 1.

Attribute definitions:
baseFrequency = "&lt;number-optional-number&gt;"The base frequency (frequencies) parameter(s) for the
noise function. If two &lt;number&gt;s are
provided, the first number represents a base frequency in
the X direction and the second value represents a base
frequency in the Y direction. If one number is provided,
then that value is used for both X and Y.
A negative value for base frequency is an error (see Error
processing).
If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as
if a value of 0 were
specified.
Animatable:
yes.numOctaves = "&lt;integer&gt;"The numOctaves parameter for the noise function.

Animatable:
yes.seed = "&lt;number&gt;"The starting number for the pseudo random number
generator.
If the attribute is not specified, then the effect is as

attempt it made to achieve smooth transitions at the border
of tiles which contain a turbulence function. Sometimes the
result will show clear discontinuities at the tile
borders.
If stitchTiles="stitch",
then the user agent will automatically adjust
baseFrequency-x and baseFrequency-y values such that the
feTurbulence node's width and height (i.e., the width and
height of the current subregion) contains an integral
number of the Perlin tile width and height for the first
octave. The baseFrequency will be adjusted up or down
depending on which way has the smallest relative (not
absolute) change as follows: Given the frequency, calculate
lowFreq=floor(width*frequency)/width and
hiFreq=ceil(width*frequency)/width. If
frequency/lowFreq &lt; hiFreq/frequency then use lowFreq,
else use hiFreq. While generating turbulence values,
generate lattice vectors as normal for Perlin Noise, except
for those lattice points that lie on the right or bottom
edges of the active area (the size of the resulting tile).
In those cases, copy the lattice vector from the opposite
edge of the active area.

If attribute ‘stitchTiles’ is not specified, then the effect is as if a value of noStitch were specified.

Animatable:
yes.type = "fractalNoise |
turbulence"Indicates whether the filter primitive should perform a
